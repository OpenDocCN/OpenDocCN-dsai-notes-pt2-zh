    model, we seek to extract the prompt that generated these outputs. We develop
    a new black-box method, output2prompt, that extracts prompts without access to
    the model’s logits and without adversarial or jailbreaking queries. Unlike previous
    methods, output2prompt only needs outputs of normal user queries. To improve memory
    efficiency, output2prompt employs a new sparse encoding techique. We measure the
    efficacy of output2prompt on a variety of user and system prompts and demonstrate
    zero-shot transferability across different LLMs. ¹¹1Code for reproducing all experiments
    is available at [https://github.com/collinzrj/output2prompt](https://github.com/collinzrj/output2prompt)'

- en: Given outputs of a large language model (LLM), is it possible to extract the
    prompt that generated these outputs? If the LLM is wrapped into an API or app
    that automatically prepends a “system prompt” to all user queries, is it possible
    to extract this system prompt by interacting with the API?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This problem is known as *language model inversion* (Morris et al., [2023b](#bib.bib22)).
    The current state-of-the-art inversion method is logit2prompt, which extracts
    inputs to the model given its logits, i.e., next-token probability distribution (Morris
    et al., [2023b](#bib.bib22)). logit2prompt cannot be applied to many LLMs, however,
    because their APIs do not reveal their logits (Carlini et al., [2024](#bib.bib4)).
    Even when a model’s logits are available (or can be inferred), inversion using
    logit2prompt can be prohibitively expensive, with hundreds of thousands of queries
    required to extract a single prompt.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another approach is to steer the model into outputting its context, including
    the system prompt, via specially crafted adversarial queries (Zhang et al., [2024](#bib.bib35)).
    This technique is not stealthy because adversarial queries are different from
    normal user queries. It is also brittle and model-specific because its efficacy
    depends on the target model’s instruction-following capabilities, lack of safety
    alignment, and the absence of defenses such as protection prompts added to system
    prompts and input and/or output filters. Finally, adversarial extraction is simply
    not possible in deployments that limit users to pre-defined queries (e.g., when
    the target LLM acts as an assistant for a fixed task).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Our contributions.  We design, implement, and evaluate output2prompt, a new
    prompt extraction method that uses only the text outputs of LLMs generated in
    response to normal user queries. output2prompt does not require access to logits,
    nor adversarial queries.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: output2prompt employs an inversion model trained on concatenations of many model
    outputs. Training such models can be computationally expensive. We observe that
    cross-input attention is not strictly necessary for prompt extraction, and utilize
    a new sparse encoder architecture whose time and memory complexity is linear in
    the number of inputs.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We evaluate output2prompt on a variety of user and system prompts, including
    those of real-world GPT Store apps (GPTs). It outperforms prior methods, including
    logit2prompt (Morris et al., [2023b](#bib.bib22))—without access to logits and
    with two orders of magnitude fewer training samples—achieving cosine similarity
    of 96.7 compared to 93.5 by logit2prompt. Unlike prior extraction methods, output2prompt
    transfers across different language models (both base and instruction-tuned) with
    little loss in performance, maintaining cosine similarity above 92.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Even when prompts extracted by output2prompt are different from the original
    prompts, we show that the extracted prompts are semantically close via high cosine
    similarity and empirical metrics such as asking an LLM whether the prompts are
    functionally similar. Prompt extraction can thus be used to clone LLM-based apps
    (e.g., GPTs) without any adversarial queries.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We consider the scenario where a hosted large language model (LLM) is available
    to users via a standard Web API. The API returns a single output in response to
    each user prompt. If the user calls the API multiple times with the same prompt,
    they may obtain different outputs. The user may also access the API indirectly,
    via an application such as a GPT Store app (OpenAI, [2024](#bib.bib23)).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The API, or an app running on top of the API, may prepend a *system prompt*
    to each user prompt. In our evaluation, we provide the system prompt as the first
    (“assistant”) turn and the user’s prompt as the second (“user”) turn. Different
    turns have different privilege levels (Wallace et al., [2024](#bib.bib33)) denoted
    by special tokens, which are managed by the system and cannot be edited by the
    user. We assume that the system will not reveal the system prompt, nor any information
    about the internal state of the LLM (such as logits (Morris et al., [2023b](#bib.bib22))),
    nor any additional APIs (such as logit bias) that could help infer this state (Carlini
    et al., [2024](#bib.bib4)). This assumption matches typical hosted LLM deployments.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Our threat model covers several realistic scenarios. In the first scenario,
    the adversary observes outputs published by other users of the API and wants to
    extract the prompts they used. In the second scenario, the adversary accesses
    the system directly and wants to extract the hidden system prompt.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this paper, we develop an extraction method that is *stealthy* and *non-adversarial*.
    The adversary’s queries (if any) should be indistinguishable from the queries
    of non-adversarial users. Stealthiness further requires that the attack be *local*.
    The adversary cannot rely on an auxiliary LLM as an oracle to either generate
    adversarial queries, or help extract prompts from observed outputs. The attack
    should also be *robust* with respect to any defenses deployed by LLMs and LLM-based
    apps. Target LLMs may block adversarial and “jailbreaking” queries via query filtering,
    and/or employ internal safeguards, such as safety alignment, to try and avoid
    disclosing their system prompts. Success of the attack should not depend on the
    efficacy of these defenses.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Attacks that use LLMs as oracles fundamentally depend on these LLMs’ (a) capability,
    and (b) availability to generate adversarial queries and/or perform adversarial
    inference in response to the adversary’s instructions. Both (a) and (b) are opaque,
    not controlled by the adversary, and can—and do—change over time (e.g., a new
    version of the LLM may refuse to assist in prompt extraction). Therefore, oracle-dependent
    attacks are not robust. We show an example of how adveresarial queries may fail
    in Appendix [E](#A5 "Appendix E Examples of adversarial queries ‣ Extracting Prompts
    by Inverting LLM Outputs").
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We operate in an even more stringent threat model. The adversary is limited
    to *non-adversarial queries only*, specifically queries that are on the model’s
    pre-defined list of supported queries (e.g., for customer service assistance),
    or else suggested by the model itself when the user asks it for suitable queries.
    By definition, such queries are indistinguishable from the queries issued by typical
    users.

    [2020](#bib.bib28); Morris et al., [2023a](#bib.bib21)). Model inversion is distinct
    from model extraction or stealing: the former aims to reconstruct model inputs,
    the latter model parameters. Recent work in NLP has shown that text inversion
    from model outputs is possible in some scenarios: (Morris et al., [2023a](#bib.bib21))
    extract inputs from text embedding vectors, while (Morris et al., [2023b](#bib.bib22))
    extract inputs from LLM outputs. The latter method requires access to logits,
    which is not available in many real-world LLM deployments (Carlini et al., [2024](#bib.bib4)).
    (Melamed et al., [2023](#bib.bib20)) characterize prompt design as an output inversion

    Adversarial queries are not stealthy. Their efficacy varies from model to model
    and assumes the absence of defenses such as prepending a prompt prefix instructing
    the model to not disclose its system prompt; input and output monitoring and filtering
    to detect and block adversarial queries and/or outputs (Inan et al., [2023](#bib.bib11);
    Lakera AI, [2024b](#bib.bib16)); and prioritizing system prompts (Wallace et al.,

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We designed, implemented, and evaluated output2prompt, a stealthy, black-box,
    transferable method for extracting prompts by inverting LLM outputs. Unlike prior
    work, output2prompt does not require the target LLMs’s logits, nor does it rely
    on adversarial or jailbreaking queries (and thus cannot be thwarted by defenses).
    Our results demonstrate that many user and system prompts are intrinsically vulnerable
    to extraction. Our new sparse encoder technique may have applications in other
    settings where LLMs operate on many independent inputs during training and inference.

    By re-confirming this principle even when LLMs deploy safeguards against adversarial
    queries, our work helps promote safer use of LLMs. LLM users should never include
    confidential information in prompts that produce public outputs, nor rely on secrecy
    of prompts to protect their LLM applications from cloning.

    by using training on an A40 GPU with 48GB of memory as an example. Sparse attention
    proved highly efficient in terms of time and computation. For our tasks, which
    involved training on 16 outputs per each prompt with a maximum length of 64 tokens,
    the full attention mechanism consumed 29.6GB of GPU memory and achieved a training
    throughput of 1.22 batches per second. In contrast, the sparse attention mechanism
    required only 7.4GB and reached a training throughput of 4.98 batches per second.
    Moreover, while the full attention mechanism could handle only one batch without
    exceeding memory limits, sparse attention could process up to ten batches, using
    45.4GB of memory and achieving a throughput of 0.60 batches per second, equivalent
    to 6.00 samples per second. This represents a nearly fivefold speed increase compared
    to the 1.22 samples per second with full attention. Notably, training or inference
    on 128 outputs is impractical with full attention on an A40 GPU, as it would exceed
    the available 48GB of memory.

    stronger assurances on token attention compared to other sparse techniques, such
    as window attention.

- en: We present an example from the Awesome-ChatGPT-Prompts dataset, and the result
    of extraction with and without finetuning the system prompt inverter on samples
    from this dataset. For the extraction without finetuning, cosine similarity is
    85.7 and the LLM Eval result is “Yes”, which means that, according to the evaluator
    LLM, the extracted prompt is likely to produce similar outputs to the ground-truth
    prompt. Without finetuning, cosine similarity is 94.6 but the LLM Eval result
    is “No”. This shows that the LLM Eval metric is noisy and does not fully capture
    functional equivalence.
