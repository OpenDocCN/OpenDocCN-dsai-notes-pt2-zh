- en: Prompt recovery in large language models (LLMs) is crucial for understanding
    how LLMs work and addressing concerns regarding privacy, copyright, etc. The trend
    towards inference-only APIs complicates this task by restricting access to essential
    outputs for recovery. To tackle this challenge, we extract prompt-related information
    from limited outputs and identify a *strong(negative)* correlation between output
    probability-based uncertainty and the success of prompt recovery. This finding
    led to the development of Deliberative PrOmpt RecoverY (DORY), our novel approach
    that leverages uncertainty to recover prompts accurately. DORY involves reconstructing
    drafts from outputs, refining these with hints, and filtering out noise based
    on uncertainty. Our evaluation across diverse LLMs and prompt benchmarks shows
    that DORY outperforms existing baselines, improving performance by approximately
    10.82% and establishing a new state-of-the-art record in prompt recovery tasks.
    Significantly, DORY operates using a single LLM without any external resources
    or model, offering a cost-effective, user-friendly prompt recovery solution.

    across various tasks, typically by parsing user-inputted prompts to generate output
    text. Considering scenarios where the input prompt is agnostic, it is particularly
    critical to recover the prompt from the output — dubbed as “Prompt Recovery”.
    Prompt recovery interests researchers for its ability to reveal system prompts
    of closed-source LLMs Morris et al. ([2023b](#biba.bib30)) and detect security
    vulnerabilities, such as user’s query theft Zheng ([2023](#biba.bib52)), high-quality
    prompt leaks Sha and Zhang ([2024](#biba.bib35)); Yang et al. ([2024](#biba.bib45)),
    and defenses bypassing to generate illegal outputs Wei et al. ([2023](#biba.bib43)).
    Moreover, it can aid experts in pinpointing the origins of LLM-generated content,
    thereby clarifying responsibility for harmful Chao et al. ([2023](#biba.bib5));
    Wu et al. ([2023](#biba.bib44)), copyright-disputed Karamolegkou et al. ([2023](#biba.bib22)),
    or gender-biased Kotek et al. ([2023](#biba.bib24)) content (detailed examples
    can be found in Appendix [A](#A1 "Appendix A Usages of Prompt Recovery Task ‣
    DORY: Deliberative Prompt Recovery for LLM")). Therefore, Prompt Recovery is a
    vital part of the application and research of LLMs.'

    the prompts from the LLMs’ outputs?* Recent works of LLMs compressing and recovering
    data on their own demonstrate that LLMs possess the capability to recover inputs Delétang
    et al. ([2023](#biba.bib6)); Wu et al. ([2023](#biba.bib44)). However, as the
    parameter scale of LLMs grows, there has been a trend towards offering inference-only
    APIs to users, such as ChatGPT John Schulman et al. ([2022](#biba.bib19)), GPT-4 Achiam
    et al. ([2023](#biba.bib1)), Gemini Team et al. ([2023](#biba.bib38)). While this
    trend does indeed facilitate user access to LLMs, it also renders the models more
    opaque, meaning that the information available for prompt recovery is severely
    limited. As Figure [1](#S1.F1 "Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ DORY: Deliberative
    Prompt Recovery for LLM") illustrates, most (if not all) API-based LLMs provide
    only the output text and associated output probabilities. In such cases with limited
    outputs, the prevailing approach for prompt recovery involves NLP experts manually
    crafting *jailbreak prompts* to induce LLMs to recover inputs based on their output Wu
    et al. ([2023](#biba.bib44)); Chao et al. ([2023](#biba.bib5)); Deng et al. ([2023](#biba.bib7));
    Liu et al. ([2023](#biba.bib27)). However, as shown in Table [2](#S5.T2 "Table
    2 ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ DORY: Deliberative Prompt Recovery for LLM"), the performance
    of *jailbreak prompts* is subpar, indicating that LLMs may not adhere to users’
    requests when prompts involve the security of LLM applications. Thus, the prompt
    recovery of LLMs currently remains a significant challenge.'

    API-based LLMs using limited output information—the output text and output probabilities.
    Surprisingly, we find that not only the output texts are related to the prompts
    intuitively, but the output probabilities are also prompt-relevant information.
    More specifically, we empirically substantiate a *strong (negative)* correlation
    between output probability-based uncertainty and prompt recovery performance across
    a variety of prompt benchmarks. At the sentence level, the Pearson correlation
    coefficient $\geq$ 0.742 in Figure [2](#S3.F2 "Figure 2 ‣ 3.2 Feasibility of recovering
    prompt from output probabilities ‣ 3 Motivation ‣ DORY: Deliberative Prompt Recovery

    the output text also appear in the prompt)* is 40%~60.7% lower than that of non-shared

    accurately recovering prompt from LLM’s output through the guidance of uncertainty.
    As illustrated in Figure [4](#S4.F4 "Figure 4 ‣ 4 Method ‣ DORY: Deliberative
    Prompt Recovery for LLM"), the core pathway is to recover prompt from clues, assembled
    by three components: *i)-Draft Reconstruction*: reconstructing the draft from
    output text; *ii)-Hint Refinement*: generating hint (i.e., shared tokens) based
    on uncertainty from outputs; *iii)-Noise Reduction*: producing draft outputs from
    the draft, followed by generating the draft hint, then comparing draft hint and
    hint to separate the noise (i.e., non-shared tokens). In experiments, we evaluate
    the DORY across multiple mainstream LLMs (ChatGPT, Llama2-7B Chat, and ChatGLM2-6B)
    on three prompt benchmarks: Alpaca, Self-Instruct, and Arxiv Math. Extensive experiments
    across different LLMs and prompt styles verified the effectiveness of DORY. Compared
    to existing baselines, DORY achieved an average performance gain of approximately
    10.82%, establishing a new state-of-the-art record in the prompt recovery task.
    Equally crucial is that DORY requires only a single LLM throughout the process,
    without needing external resources, such as additional prompt datasets or the
    development of a new model from scratch or through fine-tuning. This cost-effective
    and user-friendly approach can be seamlessly integrated into the practical deployment
    of prompt recovery for LLMs.'

    Model stealing aims to explore how to steal the LLM’s weights through interaction
    with the LLM itself Tramèr et al. ([2016](#biba.bib40)). This approach has been
    proven viable in numerous NLP areas, such as machine translation Wallace et al.
    ([2020](#biba.bib41)); Zhang et al. ([2021](#biba.bib50)) and text retrieval Dziedzic

    Morris et al. ([2023b](#biba.bib30)) have suggested that reconstructing model
    weights may only replicate models capable of mimicking surface syntax but struggle
    to recover their intrinsic decision-making mechanisms. On the contrary, the goal
    of prompt recovery is to recover the input prompts leading to specific outputs,
    thus revealing the intrinsic mechanisms of the model processing prompt. Also,
    prompt recovery can be viewed as a common attack in exposing LLMs’ risks by stealing
    user privacy Zheng ([2023](#biba.bib52)); Duan et al. ([2023a](#biba.bib9)); Steinke

    two main categories. The first category is tailored for LLMs that have accessible
    internal parameters or can obtain a vast amount of output data. This approach
    recovers prompts by analyzing embeddings Morris et al. ([2023a](#biba.bib29));
    Zheng ([2023](#biba.bib52)); Li et al. ([2023](#biba.bib25)), the distribution
    of output logits Morris et al. ([2023b](#biba.bib30)), and gradients Zheng ([2023](#biba.bib52)).
    The second category of methods is aimed at API-based LLMs that only have access
    to output text and output probabilities. This often entails the use of manually
    designed jailbreak prompts Wu et al. ([2023](#biba.bib44)); Chao et al. ([2023](#biba.bib5));
    Deng et al. ([2023](#biba.bib7)); Liu et al. ([2023](#biba.bib27)); Yu et al.
    ([2023](#biba.bib46)), leveraging human creativity, to steer LLMs towards prompt
    recovery from output text. However, the quality of jailbreak prompts varies greatly
    and typically requires substantial human effort to create. Moreover, how the output
    probabilities accompanying the output text can be integrated into the prompt recovery
    process remains unexplored. Unlike previous works, for API-based LLMs, we propose
    an innovative approach for the first time, utilizing output probabilities-based
    uncertainty Kadavath et al. ([2022](#biba.bib20)); Zhang et al. ([2024](#biba.bib48))
    to guide LLMs in recovering prompt.

    For example, on GPT-3.5-turbo, our approach realized an average recovery performance
    improvement of 19.12% in BLEU-1 compared to the optimal performance of the Jailbreak(max).
    Moreover, in contrast to the Few-shot, we achieved an average performance gain
    of 16.36% in BLEU-1. This demonstrates that while relying solely on output text
    can improve recovery performance by Few-shot, there are inherent limitations.
    Such limitations may stem from the Few-shot’s reliance solely on output text without
    extracting effective clues. In contrast, our approach extracts effective clues
    from output uncertainty and explicitly feeds them into LLM, making it easier to
    obtain content related to the ground-truth prompt. Notably, when recovering prompts
    for Arxiv Math, relying on output uncertainty, we achieve a nearly doubled improvement
    in recovery performance, reaching a peak increase of 25.34% in BLEU-1\. This indicates
    that clues contain key elements of ground-truth prompts, enabling more accurate
    guidance for LLMs in recovering prompts. Meanwhile, our approach significantly
    surpasses other methods in terms of semantic consistency (SS score), indicating
    we can more accurately recover the general concepts of the ground-truth prompt.

    output probability-based uncertainty and the success of prompt recovery, presenting
    that output probabilities hold valuable clues in prompt recovery. By these insights,
    we propose a novel approach DORY, marking a pioneering effort in utilizing uncertainty
    for accurate prompt recovery from LLM outputs. DORY operates through the extraction
    of hint with low uncertainty, identification of noise through comparison of draft
    outputs, and the combination of these elements to recover the prompt. Our empirical
    evaluation of DORY across diverse LLMs and prompt styles, including benchmarks
    such as Alpaca, Self-Instruct, and Arxiv Math, confirms its superior performance
    over existing baselines, setting a new state-of-the-art record in prompt recovery.

- en: Despite DORY achieving significant results across multiple mainstream LLMs,
    due to cost constraints, we have not been able to validate our approach on more
    advanced LLMs, such as GPT-4\. With the rapid development of LLMs, their understanding
    and reasoning capabilities are also constantly improving. Advanced LLMs like GPT-4,
    with their more powerful features and improved architectures, have pushed the
    boundaries of natural language processing. This leaves some uncertainty regarding
    the effectiveness of our approach when applied to the most advanced LLMs. However,
    exploring the effectiveness of our approach to these cutting-edge models requires
    substantial resources, including computational power and access to the models.
    Despite these limitations, we believe our approach is based on the fundamental
    principles of language modeling and prompt engineering. These principles are applicable
    to the architecture of various LLMs, which means our approach may also have potential
    on the most advanced models.

    smartphone is like a Swiss Army knife in the world of appliances. Just like a
    Swiss Army knife is a versatile tool that combines multiple functions into one
    compact device, a smartphone is a versatile gadget that combines various features
    and capabilities into a single handheld device. Similar to how an appliance serves
    a specific purpose, like a toaster for toasting bread or a blender for making
    smoothies, a smartphone serves multiple purposes. It can be your communication
    hub, allowing you to make calls, send messages, and connect with others through
    various apps. It can also be your personal assistant, with features like calendars,
    reminders, and voice assistants. Additionally, it can be your entertainment center,
    providing access to music, videos, games, and social media.Just as appliances
    have evolved over time to become more advanced and efficient, smartphones have
    also undergone significant advancements. They have become faster, more powerful,
    and equipped with high-resolution displays, advanced cameras, and various sensors.
    This evolution is similar to how appliances have become smarter, more energy-efficient,
    and equipped with advanced features to enhance our daily lives.So, in essence,

    that suggests that even in difficult or challenging situations, there is always
    something positive or hopeful to be found. It’s like saying that behind every
    dark cloud, there’s a silver lining waiting to shine through.The phrase is often
    used to encourage optimism and remind people that setbacks or hardships are not
    the end of the world. It’s a way of saying that even when things seem bleak, there
    is still a chance for something good to come out of it.For example, let’s say
    someone loses their job. It’s undoubtedly a tough situation, but the silver lining
    could be that it gives them the opportunity to explore new career paths or discover
    hidden talents they never knew they had. In this case, the loss of a job becomes
    a chance for personal growth and new beginnings.Overall, every cloud has a silver
    lining is a reminder to look for the positive aspects in challenging situations
    and to maintain hope even when things seem difficult. It’s a way of finding a
    glimmer of light in the midst of darkness. Draft: Explain the meaning and usage

    the player’s objective is to guess a secret number within a certain range.Here’s
    how it could work:1\. The game starts by generating a random secret number between
    a specified minimum and maximum value. Let’s say the range is between 1 and 100\.
    2\. The player is then prompted to enter their guess. They can input any number
    within the given range. 3\. After each guess, the game provides feedback to the
    player. If their guess is too high, the game will say Too high! If their guess
    is too low, it will say Too low! If their guess is correct, the game will congratulate
    them and end.4\. The player continues guessing until they find the correct number.
    The game keeps track of the number of attempts it takes for the player to guess
    correctly.5\. To add an extra challenge, you could implement a scoring system
    where the player earns points based on how quickly they guess the correct number.
    For example, fewer attempts could result in a higher score. Draft: Create a concept
    for a guessing game called Number Quest. Hint: game, player’s, secret, number

    advantage with prompts that are short or equal to 20 tokens in length. For longer
