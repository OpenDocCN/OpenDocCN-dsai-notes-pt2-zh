- en: Safety, security, and compliance are essential requirements when aligning large
    language models (LLMs). However, many seemingly aligned LLMs are soon shown to
    be susceptible to jailbreak attacks. These attacks aim to circumvent the models’
    safety guardrails and security mechanisms by introducing jailbreak prompts into
    malicious queries. In response to these challenges, this paper introduces Defensive
    Prompt Patch (DPP), a novel prompt-based defense mechanism specifically designed
    to protect LLMs against such sophisticated jailbreak strategies. Unlike previous
    approaches, which have often compromised the utility of the model for the sake
    of safety, DPP is designed to achieve a minimal Attack Success Rate (ASR) while
    preserving the high utility of LLMs. Our method uses strategically designed interpretable
    suffix prompts that effectively thwart a wide range of standard and adaptive jailbreak
    techniques. Empirical results conducted on LLAMA-2-7B-Chat and Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2
    models demonstrate the robustness and adaptability of DPP, showing significant
    reductions in ASR with negligible impact on utility. Our approach not only outperforms
    existing defense strategies in balancing safety and functionality, but also provides
    a scalable and interpretable solution applicable to various LLM platforms.

    such as GPT-4 [[18](#bib.bib18)], LLAMA-2 [[2](#bib.bib2)], and Mistral [[7](#bib.bib7)]
    have showcased their ability to understand and generate text akin to human interaction [[26](#bib.bib26),
    [27](#bib.bib27), [32](#bib.bib32)]. These models, powered by the Transformer
    architecture, excel in processing sequential data and understanding complex language
    patterns, hence enhancing tasks like text summarization, creative writing, and
    coding. To maintain model integrity and mitigate undesired outputs, developers
    implement alignment constraints using techniques like Reinforcement Learning with
    Human Feedback (RLHF) [[22](#bib.bib22), [23](#bib.bib23), [24](#bib.bib24)] and
    Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT).

    output, as demonstrated by various jailbreak attacks [[1](#bib.bib1), [3](#bib.bib3),
    [5](#bib.bib5), [4](#bib.bib4)]. Initial strategies like the GCG attack involve
    crafting adversarial suffixes combined with user queries to manipulate model outputs [[1](#bib.bib1)].
    More sophisticated techniques such as the AutoDAN [[3](#bib.bib3)], PAIR [[5](#bib.bib5)],
    and TAP [[4](#bib.bib4)] attacks generate interpretable jailbreak templates that
    enhance the efficacy and readability of the attacks.

- en: In response to these vulnerabilities, the development of defensive strategies [[19](#bib.bib19),
    [20](#bib.bib20), [28](#bib.bib28)] has become increasingly vital. Prompt-based
    defenses, such as Self-Reminder [[10](#bib.bib10)], Goal Prioritization [[11](#bib.bib11)],
    and RPO [[12](#bib.bib12)], involve improving system prompts to enhance LLM alignment.
    These methods are simple yet effective, requiring minimal in-depth model knowledge
    and sparing model re-training as they operate at the text input level.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Nevertheless, these prompt-based defense mechanisms frequently grapple with
    the trade-off between preserving utility and effectively mitigating jailbreaks.
    Although Goal Prioritization excels in defense, it substantially compromises model
    utility. On the other hand, RPO retains utility but provides limited defense coverage.
    While Self-Reminder achieves a better balance, it fails to deliver satisfactory
    performance on more aligned models such as LLAMA-2-7B-Chat, owing to deficiencies
    in its search algorithm for the optimal prompt. We provide a comparative analysis
    of different prompt-based defenses in Table [1](#S1.T1 "Table 1 ‣ 1 Introduction

    techniques like the PAIR and TAP Attacks [[5](#bib.bib5), [4](#bib.bib4)] automate
    the creation of jailbreak prompts using a secondary “attacker” LLM, which poses
    serious threats through black-box access to the target LLM. Similarly, the ICA
    Attack [[8](#bib.bib8)] leverages in-context learning to misaligned responses,
    and the Catastrophic Attack [[9](#bib.bib9)] manipulates generation configurations
    to trigger misaligned outputs. GCG Attack [[1](#bib.bib1)] optimize adversarial
    inputs using gradient-based approaches, and the AutoDAN Attack [[3](#bib.bib3)]
    employs genetic algorithms to refine prompts based on specific templates. Another
    notable method, the Base64 Attack [[6](#bib.bib6)], encodes malicious queries
    in Base64 to bypass content filters subtly.

    attacks to reinforce the security of LLMs. Techniques such as the Self-Reminder [[10](#bib.bib10)]

    processing. The RPO (Robust Prompt Optimization) [[12](#bib.bib12)] modifies objectives
    to minimize the perceptual distance between harmful queries and safe responses.
    Furthermore, Goal Prioritization and Default System Prompts [[11](#bib.bib11),

    generate adversarial prompts. Specifically, GCG is used to generate an adversarial
    suffix for each malicious query. Base64 encodes each harmful query in Base64 format.
    (ii) Interpretable Jailbreak Attacks – AutoDAN [[3](#bib.bib3)], PAIR [[5](#bib.bib5)],
    TAP [[4](#bib.bib4)], and ICA [[8](#bib.bib8)] are interpretable attacks that
    we used to translate the original malicious query into a new improved malicious
    query. Please refer to Appendix [A](#A1 "Appendix A Jailbreak Prompt Generations
    ‣ Defensive Prompt Patch: A Robust and Interpretable Defense of LLMs against Jailbreak
    Attacks") for more details on generating new malicious queries. (iii) Generation-based
    Jailbreak Attacks – we follow Catastrophic Attack [[9](#bib.bib9)] to vary the
    hyperparameters of the LLM to generate malicious responses for each harmful question.
    In our evaluation, similar to the Adversarial Dataset, we utilize 100 harmful
    behavior questions from AdvBench to generate new malicious queries³³3For PAIR
    and TAP adaptive attacks, we directly utilize the dataset provided in their code-base,
    which they sample 50 harmful behaviors from AdvBench., all of which will be employed
    in our experiments.'

    jailbreak attacks directly from the original LLMs (i.e., without any defense).
    From Table [2](#S4.T2 "Table 2 ‣ 4.2 Robustness against Non-adaptive and Adaptive
    Attacks ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ Defensive Prompt Patch: A Robust and Interpretable Defense
    of LLMs against Jailbreak Attacks") we can summarize the following observations.
    First, our method outperforms RPO with respect to ICA, AutoDAN, and GCG attacks.
    Specifically, it outperforms the ASR of RPO by 42% for ICA attack, 18% for AutoDAN,
    and 15% for GCG attack. For the Base64 attack, our method is comparable to RPO
    with only 1% less than RPO. Second, although Goal Prioritization is a strong defense
    mechanism against Base64 and GCG, it fails to defend against the AutoDAN attack,
    where our method is 42% better than Goal Prioritization in terms of ASR. Self-Reminder
    has the same performance as our method against the GCG attack and a slightly weaker
    performance against the Base64 attack. While our method has 10% worse defense
    performance under AutoDAN setting, it outperforms Self-Reminder on ICA attack
    by 29%. The last column of Table [2](#S4.T2 "Table 2 ‣ 4.2 Robustness against
    Non-adaptive and Adaptive Attacks ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ Defensive Prompt Patch: A
    Robust and Interpretable Defense of LLMs against Jailbreak Attacks") shows the
    utility degradation of each defense. Our method has the best Win-Rate, 82.98%,
    outrunning all the other baselines. Notably, the Goal Prioritization has the lowest
    Win-Rate, suggesting that its defense performance comes with a high cost in utility
    drop. Overall, our DPP not only achieves the lowest Average ASR of 3.80% but also
    ensures minimal utility impact, reinforcing its standing as the most robust method
    among those evaluated.'

    procedure for assessing defense effectiveness when the defense mechanism is known
    to the attack. Here, we assume the attacker can query the protected LLM with the
    defense in place when making jailbreak attempts. In this setup, we adapted the
    attack strategies described in Appendix [I](#A9 "Appendix I Adaptive Attacks Setup
    ‣ Defensive Prompt Patch: A Robust and Interpretable Defense of LLMs against Jailbreak
    Attacks"). Due to the known limited effectiveness of PAIR and TAP in the non-adaptive
    setting on the LLAMA-2-7B-Chat model, [[5](#bib.bib5), [4](#bib.bib4)], we replace
    these attacks with Catastrophic Adaptive Attack. In addition, Base64 attack is
    a static approach, so the adaptive setting cannot be directly applied to it. Therefore,
    we remove these attacks from the evaluation. Table [3](#S4.T3 "Table 3 ‣ 4.2 Robustness
    against Non-adaptive and Adaptive Attacks ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ Defensive Prompt Patch:
    A Robust and Interpretable Defense of LLMs against Jailbreak Attacks") shows the

    to ICA and GCG adaptive attacks. Although Goal Prioritization has the best ASR
    under catastrophic attacks, which is 0.33%, it fails to defend against ICA and
    AutoDAN adaptive attacks. On the other hand, our method outperforms Self-Reminder
    against all adaptive attacks except AutoDAN. Notably, our method attains the best
    Average ASR, which is 15.9% (outperforming the second-best method by more than
    8%), while RPO has the worst robustness, with an Average ASR of 52.6%. In Appendix [F](#A6
    "Appendix F Extension of LLAMA-2 Experiments ‣ Defensive Prompt Patch: A Robust

    our DPP with different initialized prototypes and found the defensive performance
    was consistent.'

    consistently surpasses other defense mechanisms in robustness, with minimal utility
    degradation across the board. This comprehensive performance solidifies our method’s

    diverse and sophisticated attacks.

    and adaptive GCG attack scenarios for the LLAMA-2-7B-Chat model.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In terms of Win-Rate, the Suffix DPP surpasses the Prefix DPP by 3% on average.
    For the GCG non-adaptive attack, the ASR for Suffix DPP is 7% lower than that
    for Prefix DPP. In the adaptive GCG settings, the ASR difference increases to
    42% between the Prefix and Suffix DPP. This ablation study concludes that Prefix
    DPP is less effective than Suffix DPP, particularly under adaptive settings. Therefore,
    we suggest using suffixes as the default DPP format in future studies.

  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The proposed Defensive Prompt Patch (DPP) framework presents a scalable and
    practical prompt-based approach to improving LLM safeguards, addressing critical
    vulnerabilities exposed by jailbreak attacks while preserving high utility of
    the protected LLM. Our method stands out by achieving an optimal balance between
    maintaining high utility and providing robust defense, thereby ensuring that the
    protected LLM simultaneously remains high efficiency and safety when facing jailbreak
    attempts. The empirical tests conducted – including LLAMA-2-7B-Chat12 and Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2
    models, 7 jailbreak attack strategies, and several state-of-the-art prompt-based
    defenses – substantiate that DPP effectively reduces the attack success rate to
    low levels with minimal impact on model performance. Moreover, the adaptability
    of DPP to function effectively even on less-aligned models underscores its potential
    as a universal defensive solution in various LLM models. The interpretable property
    of our DPP also opens up a new avenue to infusing and accelerating prompt engineering
    by human users for enhancing LLM safety alignment.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Prototype selection One of the primary limitations of our DPP algorithm arises
    from the selection of prototypes. When an effective prototype is selected, our
    DPP algorithm is capable of enhancing the prototype into a superior DPP. Conversely,
    if the prototype is ineffective, the performance of the trained DPP is compromised.
    Therefore, the careful selection of the prototype prompt is crucial for the successful
    mitigation of jailbreak attacks. In future work, we aim to explore methods to
    relax these prototype selection constraints.

- en: Computational Efficiency and Scalability The DPP training algorithm, which involves
    a Hierarchical Genetic Algorithm (HGA), is computationally intensive. The scalability
    of our approach to larger datasets or more extensive model deployments may be
    limited by the computational resources required for iterative optimization and
    evaluation. As model sizes and the volume of data grow, the efficiency of DPP
    in real-time applications may need further optimization.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Cost of Training with DPP The DPP training algorithm requires a LLM to revise
    the prototype prompt, and currently, we are using GPT-4 as the revising LLM, therefore,
    the cost of accessing OpenAI platform is considerable high for this training process.
    In order to minimize the cost of training, one approach is to replace the GPT-4
    with some open-sourced LLMs, which will be the future scope of this work.

- en: 'Limitations of other defense baselines We noticed that other defense baselines
    also contain limitations. For Self-Reminder, we notice this training procedure
    works poorly on LLAMA-2-7B-Chat model. Since its well-alignment, it will often
    refuse to improve upon the defense prompt. For RPO, the main limitation is the
    training time. RPO adopted the GCG attack training procedure, and thus results
    a high computational cost for finding the defense suffix. We also observe the
    inefficient of RPO when defending jailbreak attacks which is discussed in Appendix [B](#A2
    "Appendix B Performance Investigation for RPO ‣ Defensive Prompt Patch: A Robust
    and Interpretable Defense of LLMs against Jailbreak Attacks"). Goal Prioritization
    is strong defense against GCG attack, but it seems less effective when defending
    AutoDAN, TAP and PAIR attacks. Moreover, it contains a long in-context learning,
    which cause the inference time when adding Goal Prioritization increases. From
    both LLAMA-2-7B-Chat and Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2, we observe the utility degradation
    is large for Goal Prioritization.'

- en: As LLMs become more integrated into various applications, they are increasingly
    susceptible to jailbreak attacks that can manipulate their outputs for malicious
    purposes such as disinformation, generating fake profiles, or enabling surveillance.
    Our DPP approach significantly enhances the robustness of LLMs against these sophisticated
    attacks, thereby mitigating the risks of misuse. Furthermore, by preserving the
    high utility of LLMs while ensuring minimal Attack Success Rate (ASR), DPP strikes
    a crucial balance between functionality and security, making it a scalable solution
    across different LLM platforms. However, it is essential to acknowledge that even
    with such safeguards, there could still be unintended consequences, such as false
    positives in detecting malicious prompts, which may hinder legitimate uses. To
    address potential negative impacts, we propose continuous monitoring and iterative
    improvement of the DPP mechanisms, along with transparent reporting of any detected
    vulnerabilities. Through these measures, we aim to contribute to the responsible
    and ethical advancement of LLM technology. Therefore, we do not foresee any negative
    impact of our work.
