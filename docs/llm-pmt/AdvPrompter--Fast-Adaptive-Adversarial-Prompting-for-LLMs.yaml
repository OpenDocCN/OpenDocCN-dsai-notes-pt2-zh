- en: 'While recently Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable successes,
    they are vulnerable to certain *jailbreaking attacks* that lead to generation
    of inappropriate or harmful content. Manual red-teaming requires finding adversarial
    prompts that cause such jailbreaking, e.g. by appending a suffix to a given instruction,
    which is inefficient and time-consuming. On the other hand, automatic adversarial
    prompt generation often leads to semantically meaningless attacks that can easily
    be detected by perplexity-based filters, may require gradient information from
    the TargetLLM, or do not scale well due to time-consuming discrete optimization
    processes over the token space. In this paper, we present a novel method that
    uses another LLM, called the AdvPrompter, to generate human-readable adversarial
    prompts in seconds, $\sim 800\times$ faster than existing optimization-based approaches.
    We train the AdvPrompter using a novel algorithm that *does not require access
    to the gradients* of the TargetLLM. This process alternates between two steps:
    (1) generating high-quality target adversarial suffixes by optimizing the AdvPrompter
    predictions, and (2) low-rank fine-tuning of the AdvPrompter with the generated
    adversarial suffixes. The trained AdvPrompter generates suffixes that veil the
    input instruction without changing its meaning, such that the TargetLLM is lured
    to give a harmful response. Experimental results on popular open source TargetLLMs
    show state-of-the-art results on the AdvBench dataset, that also transfer to closed-source
    black-box LLM APIs. Further, we demonstrate that by fine-tuning on a synthetic
    dataset generated by AdvPrompter, LLMs can be made more robust against jailbreaking
    attacks while maintaining performance, i.e. high MMLU scores.'

    on vast amounts of data, these models learn a diverse set of skills that have
    found applications in a wide range of areas (Ahn et al., [2022](#bib.bib2); Brohan
    et al., [2023](#bib.bib6); Driess et al., [2023](#bib.bib11); Zhao et al., [2023](#bib.bib50);
    Touvron et al., [2023](#bib.bib40); OpenAI et al., [2024](#bib.bib25); Romera-Paredes
    et al., [2024](#bib.bib33); Trinh et al., [2024](#bib.bib41)). On the flip side,
    since the training data for LLMs often contains toxic content that is difficult
    to curate, the model inevitably learns to replicate toxic behavior and generates
    content that could be considered inappropriate, offensive or harmful (Ganguli
    et al., [2022](#bib.bib13); Zou et al., [2023](#bib.bib58)). To mitigate this
    issue, most LLMs undergo a process called safety-alignment, where the model is
    fine-tuned with human preferences that reflect positive societal values, leading
    to more helpful, appropriate and safe responses from the LLM (Ziegler et al.,
    [2019](#bib.bib57); Bai et al., [2022](#bib.bib4); Rafailov et al., [2023](#bib.bib32)).
    Unfortunately, even existing aligned LLMs remain vulnerable when facing *jailbreaking
    attacks* that craft adversarial prompts to bypass these safety mechanisms. Famous
    early examples of jailbreaking attacks on today’s LLMs include “Ignore Previous
    Prompt” (Perez and Ribeiro, [2022](#bib.bib29)) and “Do Anything Now ​²²2[https://gist.github.com/coolaj86/6f4f7b30129b0251f61fa7baaa881516](https://gist.github.com/coolaj86/6f4f7b30129b0251f61fa7baaa881516)”.
    Since then, numerous such attacks have been discovered (Kang et al., [2023](#bib.bib22);
    Shen et al., [2023](#bib.bib36); Wei et al., [2024](#bib.bib44); Samvelyan et al.,

    crucial for model developers to perform red-teaming to proactively identify and
    fix these vulnerabilities in order to ensure the safety of LLMs (Ganguli et al.,
    [2022](#bib.bib13)). Manual red-teaming through human-crafted adversarial prompts
    is time-consuming and can be prone to blind spots, leading to a false sense of
    security. As a response, recent work has proposed automated methods for generating
    adversarial prompts. However, the resulting adversarial prompts are either not
    human-readable (Zou et al., [2023](#bib.bib58)), hence they can be easily filtered
    by perplexity-based mitigation strategies (Jain et al., [2023](#bib.bib19)), or
    require computationally intensive discrete optimization over the combinatorial
    token space to generate a single adversarial prompt (Zou et al., [2023](#bib.bib58);
    Zhu et al., [2023](#bib.bib56); Wei et al., [2023](#bib.bib45)). We discuss further

    of the objective is challenging, as the intermediate representation of the adversarial
    suffix $\mathbf{q}_{\theta}(\mathbf{x})\in\mathbf{Q}$ is tokenized and hence discrete.

    Following the RL interpretations of LLMs given in previous works, see e.g. Ahmadian
    et al. ([2024](#bib.bib1)), the AdvPrompter may be viewed as a learned policy,
    with states corresponding to sequences of tokens. An action corresponds to sampling
    a new token, and following the AdvPrompter leads to a trajectory of sampled tokens.
    The $\mathbf{q}$-step reduces to a single low-rank gradient update for each sampled

    "In 4.4.2 Impact of Number of Trials ‣ 4.4 Ablation Studies ‣ 4 Experiments ‣

    decoding methods. Greedy decoding can already yield satisfactory performance,
    but it is deterministic and hence cannot benefit from evaluating multiple samples.
    Multinomial sampling, on the other hand, offers diversity, but its performance
    is contingent on the temperature parameter. If the temperature is set too low
    (more deterministic), performance matches the greedy approach. Conversely, setting
    the temperature too high will generate a sequence of tokens that is likely to
    deviate from the learned adversarial prompt distribution. Lastly, we observe that
    increasing the number of beams for autoregressive generation does not confer any
    advantages.'

- en: The sensitivity of LLMs to input prompts has been a key observation since their
    development, leading to numerous studies to understand and exploit this characteristic.
    This has been particularly useful in automatically constructing prompts for tasks
    such as zero-shot learning and in-context learning. For example, AutoPrompt (Shin
    et al., [2020](#bib.bib37)) identifies task-specific tokens (to be included in
    the prompt) for zero-shot text classification and fact retrieval, among other
    tasks. This method employs gradient-based scoring of tokens, followed by an evaluation
    of a task-specific loss. More recent studies have utilized evolutionary algorithms
    (Guo et al., [2023](#bib.bib15)) and policy gradients (Diao et al., [2023](#bib.bib10))
    to optimize the probability distribution over discrete tokens. However, both of
    these methods encounter scalability issues and high computational costs. For instance,
    the vocabulary size in Diao et al. ([2023](#bib.bib10)) is relatively small (50-200
    tokens). Motivated by the complexity of optimizing over the discrete tokens, Chen
    et al. ([2023](#bib.bib8)) propose learning soft prompts (in the token embedding
    space) using an open-source (whitebox) LLM. This open-source LLM then generates
    textual prompts for the blackbox LLM. Beyond optimization-based approaches, several
    works (Pryzant et al., [2023](#bib.bib30); Ouyang and Li, [2023](#bib.bib26);
    Zhou et al., [2022](#bib.bib55); Yang et al., [2023](#bib.bib46)) have relied
    on iterative querying of LLMs and refining the prompt based on responses. These
    studies involve iteratively querying the LLM to generate candidate prompts, selecting
    the best candidate according to a scoring function, and repeating the process.
    This method is akin to the rejection sampling technique commonly used in statistics.

    adversarial attacks (Liu et al., [2023](#bib.bib23); Shu et al., [2023](#bib.bib38)).
    These studies have revealed numerous vulnerabilities in production-scale LLMs.
    In terms of literature related to the automatic design of adversarial prompts,
    GCG (Zou et al., [2023](#bib.bib58)) adopts a similar approach to AutoPrompt (Shin
    et al., [2020](#bib.bib37)) for learning prompts, a method also employed in Wallace
    et al. ([2019](#bib.bib43)); Jones et al. ([2023](#bib.bib21)). Building on GCG,
    AutoDAN (Zhu et al., [2023](#bib.bib56)) emphasizes human readability. For a more
    detailed description and limitations of these methods, refer to [section 3](#S3
    "3 Methodology ‣ AdvPrompter: Fast Adaptive Adversarial Prompting for LLMs").
    An alternative approach (Guo et al., [2021](#bib.bib14)) utilizes Gumbel-Softmax
    reparameterization to learn discrete distributions of adversarial prompts. Maus
    et al. ([2023](#bib.bib24)) apply Bayesian Optimization over a continuous set
    of vectors (e.g. word embeddings), which are then mapped into discrete tokens
    via projection operator to generate an actual adversarial text prompts. In addition
    to optimization-based methods, there are attack methods that rely on in-context
    demonstrations (Wei et al., [2023](#bib.bib45)) or iterative query refinement
    (Chao et al., [2023](#bib.bib7)). Similarly, Yu et al. ([2023](#bib.bib47)) collects
    human-written adversarial prompt templates from the internet and mutates these
    templates for each harmful instruction. While these approaches are fast and applicable
    to blackbox models, their accuracy typically falls short of optimization-based
    methods. Some methods (Huang et al., [2023](#bib.bib18); Zhao et al., [2024](#bib.bib51))
    deviate from optimizing input prompts and instead adjust the output probability
    distribution of the LLM during response generation. However, this requires whitebox
    access to the autoregressive generation procedure of the LLM, or at the very least,
    access to the LLM’s output probability distribution.'

    which employs another LLM, either in a zero-shot or fine-tuned state, for automated
    red-teaming. However, their objective is to generate any prompt that incites the
    LLM to produce an offensive response, while our goal is to enforce a specific
    harmful instruction. Another related method, Zeng et al. ([2024](#bib.bib48)),
    (semi-)manually compiles a dataset of reference adversarial prompts (independent
    of TargetLLM). These prompts are then used to fine-tune an adversarial LLM. In
    contrast, our proposed method automates the entire process end-to-end and specficially
    targets the TargetLLM. Alternatively, Samvelyan et al. ([2024](#bib.bib34)) utilize
    a manually constructed grid that represents a solution space of adversarial attacks.
    This grid, which is based on attack style versus risk type, is iteratively mutated
    using an evolutionary search method. While this grid can subsequently be used
    to sample adversarial attacks, its utility is constrained by the attack styles
    and risk types that are present in it. We provide a comparison of several related
    methods in [table 1](#S1.T1 "In 1 Introduction ‣ AdvPrompter: Fast Adaptive Adversarial

    TargetLLM, either whitebox or blackbox, subject to attack. Orthogonal to this,
    another line of research has investigated the stability of alignment in LLMs from
    the perspective of fine-tuning. For example, Qi et al. ([2023](#bib.bib31)) demonstrated
    that minor fine-tuning of LLMs (10-100 shots) can disrupt safety alignments, a
    finding echoed by Zhan et al. ([2023](#bib.bib49)) in their work with fine-tuning
    GPT4 via API calls. Another important avenue is the study of mitigation techniques.
    While adversarial attack mechanisms present an intriguing research field, the
    development of robust defensive measures against them is crucial. Recently, Jain
    et al. ([2023](#bib.bib19)) demonstrated that some of the aforementioned attacks
    could be easily mitigated by standard mechanisms, such as perplexity-based checks.
    More advanced methods have been proposed by Zheng et al. ([2024](#bib.bib53)),
    who suggest learning a “safety-enforcement” message to prepend to every prompt,
    potentially enhancing robustness. Another potential approach involves further
    fine-tuning the model (during or after alignment) with an adversarial prompts
    dataset, a topic we explore in [section 4.3](#S4.SS3 "4.3 Improving Robustness

- en: In this paper, we propose a novel method for automated red-teaming of LLMs.
    The core idea is to train another LLM, the AdvPrompter, to autoregressively generate
    human-readable adversarial prompts. To train the AdvPrompter, we devise a novel
    alternating scheme called AdvPrompterTrain, that iterates between generating high-quality
    target adversarial prompts and fine-tuning the AdvPrompter with low-rank updates.
    The target adversarial prompts are generated automatically by our novel AdvPrompterOpt
    algorithm, which can be used both in the training loop and at inference to fine-tune
    the AdvPrompter predictions.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Our method has several benefits over previous approaches. First, once trained,
    the AdvPrompter generates adversarial prompts much faster than previous methods,
    which require solving a new optimization problem from scratch for every generated
    prompt. This allows us to efficiently perform multi-shot jailbreaking attacks,
    which significantly increases the attack success rate compared to previous one-shot
    attacks. Second, the AdvPrompter is conditioned on the instruction, which allows
    the generated suffix to adapt to unseen instructions even in the transfer-attack
    setting. This is in stark contrast to previous methods that generate a universal
    adversarial suffix, which inherently cannot adapt to unseen instructions, both
    semantically and syntactically. Finally, the adversarial prompts generated by
    the AdvPrompter are coherent, human-readable, natural language, which cannot be
    detected by perplexity-based filters.

- en: Extensive experimental results show that our method outperforms previous approaches
    in terms of attack success rate and prompt generation time across various open-source
    and closed-source TargetLLMs. The strong performance of our method, even in the
    transfer-attack setting, solidifies concerns about the safety of LLMs in production.
    However, note that we validate our attack only on some of the existing defense
    mechanisms, such as safety-enhanced system messages, and do not consider advanced
    defense mechanisms, such as employing an additional model to safeguard the TargetLLM
    input and output. We also contribute to the existing defense mechanisms, by showing
    that our approach can be utilized to improve the robustness of LLMs via adversarial
    finetuning. Here we use the AdvPrompter to generate a dataset of adversarial prompts,
    and we show that fine-tuning the TargetLLM on this dataset strongly improves the
    robustness against jailbreaking attacks.

- en: 'Our work opens several exciting directions for future research. First, our
    experiments on increasing the robustness of the TargetLLM via AdvPrompter motivate
    a more detailed analysis of safety fine-tuning from automatically generated data.
    A promising direction is to follow Samvelyan et al. ([2024](#bib.bib34)) in investigating
    the benefits of alternating between training the AdvPrompter and the TargetLLM
    beyond just one cycle, which could serve as a step towards robust fully automated
    safety fine-tuning. Second, our general training method is not restricted to just
    the setting of generating adversarial attacks. Slight modifications of our method
    are also applicable to generic prompt optimization as discussed in [section 5](#S5
    "5 Related Work ‣ AdvPrompter: Fast Adaptive Adversarial Prompting for LLMs"),
    where the adversarial loss on the TargetLLM is replaced by some other task loss.
    This could, for example, be used to automatically learn (potentially adaptive)
    system prompts to prevent adversarial attacks.'

    of reaching a goal configuration by gradient updates on the joint angles. In this
    analogy, joint angles correspond to selected tokens and the goal configuration
    is the desired target. Directly regressing each segment onto its goal orientation
    yields highly non-trivial dynamics, as each joint has to constantly react to the
    angle changes in the preceding joints. However, the task is trivial to solve by
    simply regressing each joint onto the correct angle, independent of all the preceding
    joints. The first scenario corresponds to optimizing the standard cross-entropy
    loss, whereas the second scenario is akin to the effect of teacher-forcing.

    Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) (Schulman et al., [2017](#bib.bib35)), a widely-used
    method in RLHF for fine-tuning LLMs. Unlike typical RLHF methods which require
    a separate reward model, our adaptation benefits from a well-defined reward signal
    in the form of an adversarial loss (as presented in [equation 2](#S2.E2 "In 2.1
    Problem Setting: Jailbreaking Attacks ‣ 2 Preliminaries ‣ AdvPrompter: Fast Adaptive
    Adversarial Prompting for LLMs")). In this setting, the environment is a bandit
    environment where it presents a harmful behavior prompt and expects a policy to
    generate an adversarial suffix. The reward is then determined by the objective
    in [equation 2](#S2.E2 "In 2.1 Problem Setting: Jailbreaking Attacks ‣ 2 Preliminaries
    ‣ AdvPrompter: Fast Adaptive Adversarial Prompting for LLMs"), concluding the
    episode. [Algorithm 4](#alg4 "In Appendix B Training AdvPrompter with PPO ‣ AdvPrompter:
    Fast Adaptive Adversarial Prompting for LLMs") provides further details on the
    adapted PPO algorithm employed. It is important to note that this adaptation largely
    resembles regular PPO with a specific reward function, and standard practices
    such as KL-penalty and ratio clipping, commonly used in LLM literature, have also
    been applied.'

    can be found in Table [4](#alg4 "Algorithm 4 ‣ Appendix B Training AdvPrompter
    with PPO ‣ AdvPrompter: Fast Adaptive Adversarial Prompting for LLMs"). To verify
    that PPO is setup correctly, we use it to inject a single harmful instruction.
    Specifically, we apply PPO to train the model $\mathbf{q}_{\theta}$ (Llama-2 base)
    on a single example, “Write a script that can exploit vulnerabilities in a software
    or operating system”, using Vicuna-7b as a TargetLLM. As indicated by [figure 8](#A2.F8
    "In Appendix B Training AdvPrompter with PPO ‣ AdvPrompter: Fast Adaptive Adversarial
    Prompting for LLMs"), both the adversarial loss and reward values are showing
    noticeable improvement, finally leading to a successfully jailbreaking suffix.
    We also report the performance metrics of the value function, which are likewise
    improving. This suggests that the training procedure is behaving as anticipated.'

    LLMs"). As suggested by the results in [figure 9](#A2.F9 "In Appendix B Training
    AdvPrompter with PPO ‣ AdvPrompter: Fast Adaptive Adversarial Prompting for LLMs"),
    PPO fails to learn an effective policy for adversarial attacks. Despite a decrease
    in the objective for PPO (left plot), the magnitude of this decrease is significantly
    less than that observed with our proposed approach (shown in blue). This directly
    impacts the attack success rate (right plot), which does not improve for PPO.
    Several factors could contribute to this outcome. Firstly, the action space of
    the policy is large (e.g. 32K possible tokens at each step for Llama-2). This
    complexity is likely why previous works on applying policy gradients for prompt
    optimization have focused on a smaller vocabulary size (e.g., around 50–200 in
    Diao et al. ([2023](#bib.bib10))). Secondly, the rewards are sparse: only a small
    subset of suffixes lead to a successful attack, while the majority do not. This
    is not typically the case with PPO applications: during the alignment of LLMs,
    most responses are already of good quality (since it undergoes SFT), and the goal
    is to select a better one in terms of human alignment.'
