  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Due to the widespread use of large language models (LLMs) in ubiquitous systems,
    we need to understand whether they embed a specific “worldview” and what these
    views reflect. Recent studies report that, prompted with political questionnaires,
    LLMs show left-liberal leanings Feng et al. ([2023](#bib.bib12)); Motoki et al.
    ([2023](#bib.bib24)). However, it is as yet unclear whether these leanings are
    reliable (robust to prompt variations) and whether the leaning is consistent across
    policies and political leaning. We propose a series of tests which assess the
    reliability and consistency of LLMs’ stances on political statements based on
    a dataset of voting-advice questionnaires collected from seven EU countries and
    annotated for policy domains. We study LLMs ranging in size from 7B to 70B parameters
    and find that their reliability increases with parameter count. Larger models
    show overall stronger alignment with left-leaning parties but differ among policy
    programs: They evince a (left-wing) positive stance towards environment protection,
    social welfare but also (right-wing) law and order, with no consistent preferences
    in foreign policy, migration, and economy.'

- en: Ensuring space for a plurality of ideas and opinions is crucial to keep democracies
    healthily operating (McQuail, [1993](#bib.bib22); Loecherbach et al., [2020](#bib.bib21)).
    Given that one such space — the interaction with chatbots powered by LLMs — is
    becoming increasingly prevalent, the importance of unveiling biases in LLMs’ output
    is clear. Continuing previous work on identifying biases in general NLP resources
    and models (Hovy and Prabhumoye, [2021](#bib.bib16)), a number of studies have
    found biases of numerous types in LLMs, relating to gender Kotek et al. ([2023](#bib.bib20)),
    race (Omiye et al., [2023](#bib.bib25)), culture Arora et al. ([2023](#bib.bib2));
    Wang et al. ([2023b](#bib.bib34)), and political position Feng et al. ([2023](#bib.bib12)).
    Such biases need to be understood when developing downstream applications to avoid
    harmful or unpleasant effects on users.

- en: In this paper, we focus on a specific type of bias, namely the political stances
    of LLMs ¹¹1Cf. [https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/08/16/chatgpt-ai-political-bias-research/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/08/16/chatgpt-ai-political-bias-research/).
    Recent studies have suggested that LLMs agree more with left-wing statements (Feng
    et al., [2023](#bib.bib12); Motoki et al., [2023](#bib.bib24)), and ascribe a
    leftist “worldview” to them, using a term from Bender et al. ([2021](#bib.bib3)).
    However, from our point of view, current results are not sufficient to attribute
    worldviews to models. First, a fundamental prerequisite for such a claim should
    be reliable behavior ²²2We adopt the term “reliability”, as consistency over testing
    replications, from psychometry (American Educational Research Association et al.,
    [1999](#bib.bib1)). and consistency in the political leaning. As for reliability,
    models should give consistent answers irrespective of the formulation of the prompts.
    If this is not the case, models merely react to linguistic peculiarities (e.g.,
    lexical choice – see Section 2 for details). As for consistency, political worldviews
    should engender a consistent stance towards broad policy domains, with limited
    variance among statements within these domains, as well as a consistent commitment
    to a right or left leaning across domains. Existing studies investigate neither
    of these in detail.

    shuffling the option order within the prompt Durmus et al. ([2023](#bib.bib10))

    reliable “attitudes” from LLMs (Tjuatja et al., [2023](#bib.bib31); Dominguez-Olmedo

    set of statements derived from Voting Advice Applications (VAAs). VAAs are tools
    that provide voters with insights on which parties are best aligned with their
    own opinions regarding policy issues. Unlike the frequently used Political Compass
    questionnaire, which categorizes political attitudes into a two-axis system (left/right
    and authoritarian/libertarian), VAAs offer a nuanced approach that ground political
    leanings in stances towards practical policies Palfrey and Poole ([1987](#bib.bib26));
    Tavits ([2007](#bib.bib30)). These stances allow for a direct comparison of responses
    with those from national parties and/or candidates. On the one hand, this offers
    a more unbiased basis for measuring political leanings, as it does not rely on
    the questionnaire designer’s external classification to determine if an answer
    aligns with the "left" or "right" side of the political spectrum. On the other
    hand, it covers a wide range of policy domains that varies from environmental
    protection to government expenditures, providing more fine-grained insights on

    sensitivity to different prompt formulations. Overall, the higher the number of
    parameters, the more reliable models are, as shown in previous studies (Shu et al.,
    [2023](#bib.bib29)). Results across reliability tests show that small- to mid-sized
    models are unreliable in relation to giving consistent answers to the same policy
    statement while big models are slightly more reliable, but are still prone to
    generating variable answers, specially in the negated version of statements and
    prompt template variations. Even though previous studies Feng et al. ([2023](#bib.bib12));
    Motoki et al. ([2023](#bib.bib24)) found that models have a tendency to be more
    aligned with the left-leaning ideology, this can be reliably claimed for LLMs
    with at least 20B parameters count. The results also shed light on the importance
    of carrying out various tests in order to understand whether a political worldview
    is really embedded in LLMs due to the training regime (data, parameters, and learning

    by right-leaning parties (Burst et al., [2021](#bib.bib5)). Results thus suggest
    that mid- and big-size models show a certain degree of inconsistency in terms
    of political leaning – favoring a few left-leaning, one right-leaning agenda,
    and showing no preference for some key electoral issues. The results of this last
    analysis emphasize the need for a thorough evaluation of the stances taken in

- en: We find that models align best with parties from the left part of the political
    spectrum, but that even large models lack consistency for at least some salient
    policy domains, such as migration and economy, and favor policies in the domain
    of law and order policies that do not correspond to the general left-leaning programs.
    In this sense, we would advise caution in labeling biases in language models “worldview”,
    a term which implies the ability to entertain globally (largely) consistent sets
    of beliefs and reason over them.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Even though we applied the idea of reliability-aware evaluation to political
    bias in this paper, we believe that the usefulness of our proposal extends to
    the analysis of type of bias in generative LLMs. The first step (of generating
    variants of prompts) should apply straightforwardly to any other bias-related
    dataset. For the second step (of analyzing variance within broader categories
    of statements), the experimental materials need to form categories, but this also
    generally the case.
  prefs: []

- en: 'A crucial question is how to appraise the outcome of our analysis: are reliable
    biases in LLMs good, as long as they align with desirable political values, or
    would we rather have high-variance models that do not commit to specific political
    leanings? In either case, our findings highlight the need to understand where
    in the process of LLM construction these biases arise, during pre-training, the
    instruct-fine-tuning, or reinforcement learning stages.'

    neutral reduce the degree of nuanced perspectives from the parties and the models,
    as the original questionnaires provide a broader spectrum of response options.⁸⁸8We
    have checked the correlation of the distance between parties with a simplified
    version of answers in comparison with the full range, and observed an average
    $r=$0.05), suggesting that the simplification does not affect party stance (shown
    in Table [9](#A1.T9 "Table 9 ‣ A.2 Answers of the VAAs ‣ Appendix A Appendix -
    Data ‣ Beyond prompt brittleness: Evaluating the reliability and consistency of
    political worldviews in LLMs") in Appendix [A](#A1 "Appendix A Appendix - Data
    ‣ Beyond prompt brittleness: Evaluating the reliability and consistency of political
    worldviews in LLMs")). Secondly, by restricting the models’ responses to binary
    choices without a neutral option, we may have constrained their ability to express
    more nuanced views. Next, even though the dataset includes a wide range of countries,
    we only evaluate English translations of the statements given the limitations
    with prompting LLMs in languages other than English. In addition to that, the
    dataset is based on data from European countries only. Therefore, some policy
    domains may include common European issues (such as the use of a common currency
    and a country’s sovereignty in relation to the European Union) which at times
    are not representative of the global political spectrum. Finally, given that base
    models did not yield reliable responses in our setup, it suggests that prompting
    is not the ideal way of identifying biases in base models given that they have
    not been trained for this purpose. This opens a venue for further investigation
    concerning the difference of biases between chat and base models, and an opportunity
    to learn where biases stem from.'

- en: In the survey, expert annotators place parties in a scale from 0 to 10 that
    indicates how left or right a party is (0 is extreme left and 10 extreme right).
    Therefore, in our study, parties below 4 are considered left, between 4 and 6
    are referred to as center and the remaining ones are right. All countries from
    ProbVAA are available in the survey, except for Switzerland. In their case, we
    annotate one of the three leanings for each of their six main parties according
    to the information available on their Wikipedia page.

- en: We ran an initial experiment with all open-source models using 14 prompts (8
    impersonal, 6 personal) on a subset of the data containing 10 statements per country.
    We sampled 30 answers for each prompt and each prompt variant and selected the
    three prompts that resulted in the highest number of reliable responses (i.e.
    responses that could be clearly mapped to a stance) for each category (personal,
    impersonal). To lower the costs with experiments on gpt3.5-20b, we manually tested
    each template with 5 statements and counted the number of reliable responses for
    each template. We noticed that the personal templates worked less well here so
    we selected 4 impersonal and 2 personal templates for gpt3.5-20b. The remaining
    experiments of this study are conducted using the six prompts that were selected
    in this process.
