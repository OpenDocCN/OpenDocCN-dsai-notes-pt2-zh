- en: 'The safety alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs) is vulnerable to both
    manual and automated jailbreak attacks, which adversarially trigger LLMs to output
    harmful content. However, current methods for jailbreaking LLMs, which nest entire
    harmful prompts, are not effective at concealing malicious intent and can be easily
    identified and rejected by well-aligned LLMs. This paper discovers that decomposing
    a malicious prompt into separated sub-prompts can effectively obscure its underlying
    malicious intent by presenting it in a fragmented, less detectable form, thereby
    addressing these limitations. We introduce an automatic prompt Decomposition and
    Reconstruction framework for jailbreak Attack (DrAttack). DrAttack includes three
    key components: (a) ‘Decomposition’ of the original prompt into sub-prompts, (b)
    ‘Reconstruction’ of these sub-prompts implicitly by in-context learning with semantically
    similar but harmless reassembling demo, and (c) a ‘Synonym Search’ of sub-prompts,
    aiming to find sub-prompts’ synonyms that maintain the original intent while jailbreaking
    LLMs. An extensive empirical study across multiple open-source and closed-source
    LLMs demonstrates that, with a significantly reduced number of queries, DrAttack
    obtains a substantial gain of success rate over prior SOTA prompt-only attackers.
    Notably, the success rate of 78.0% on GPT-4 with merely 15 queries surpassed previous
    art by 33.1%. Project is available at [https://github.com/xirui-li/DrAttack](https://github.com/xirui-li/DrAttack).'

    Touvron et al., [2023](#bib.bib30); Chowdhery et al., [2023](#bib.bib4)) has enabled
    AI systems to achieve great success in various tasks. However, these successes
    are accompanied by emerging vulnerabilities in LLMs, such as susceptibility to
    jailbreaking attacks (Mozes et al., [2023](#bib.bib19)), which have been rigorously
    studied (Ouyang et al., [2022](#bib.bib23); Bai et al., [2022](#bib.bib1); Glaese
    et al., [2022](#bib.bib9); Wolf et al., [2023](#bib.bib35)). To hide harmful intentions
    of an attack prompt, current automatic jailbreak attacks focus on generating surrounding
    contents, including suffix contents optimization (Zou et al., [2023](#bib.bib42);
    Zhu et al., [2023](#bib.bib41); Liu et al., [2023](#bib.bib18); Lapid et al.,

    entity makes the inherent malice detectable, undermining the attack success rate.

- en: In this study, we explore a more effective automatic jailbreak strategy that
    modifies sub-prompts of the original attack prompt to conceal the malice and,
    at the same time, shrink the search space to make the search more efficient. This
    strategy is motivated by the insight that attack prompts’ malicious intentions
    are built on phrases’ semantic binding, e.g., “make a bomb”. In contrast, a separate
    phrase such as “make” or “a bomb” is more neutral and is less likely to trigger
    the rejection by LLMs.

    ‣ DrAttack: Prompt Decomposition and Reconstruction Makes Powerful LLM Jailbreakers"),
    our algorithm, Decomposition-and-Reconstruction Attack (DrAttack), operates through
    a three-step process: (1) Decomposition via Semantic-Parsing breaks down a malicious
    prompt into seemingly neutral sub-prompts. (2) Implicit Reconstruction via In-Context
    Learning reassembles sub-prompts by benign and semantic-similar assembling context.
    (3) Sub-prompt Synonym Search shrinks the search space to make the search more
    efficient than optimization in whole vocabulary. Our extensive empirical experiments
    demonstrate that DrAttack can be effectively applied to a broad class of open-source
    and closed-source LLMs and substantially increase the success rate over prior
    SOTA attacks. On GPT-4, DrAttack achieves an attack success rate of over 84.6%
    (under human evaluation) and 62.0% (under LLM evaluation), surpassing the previous
    best results by over 30% in absolute terms for both assessments.'

    the vulnerabilities of LLMs, which could be regarded as a critical process in
    enhancing the design of safer systems. This is achieved by generating surrounding
    content to hide the harmful intention of the original prompt. Existing attackers
    can be roughly categorized into three groups: 1). Suffix-based methods augment
    the harmful prompt with a suffix content, optimized to trick LLM into generating
    desired malicious responses (Zou et al., [2023](#bib.bib42); Zhu et al., [2023](#bib.bib41);
    Shah et al., [2023](#bib.bib26); Lapid et al., [2023](#bib.bib15)). Following
    GCG (Zou et al., [2023](#bib.bib42)) that optimizes suffixes from random initialization,
    AutoDAN-b (Zhu et al., [2023](#bib.bib41)) further improves the interpretability
    of generated suffixes via perplexity regularization. To reduce the dependency
    on white-box models of these methods, several attempts are made to extend them
    to black box settings either via words replacement (Lapid et al., [2023](#bib.bib15))
    or using open-source LLMs as the surrogate approximator (Shah et al., [2023](#bib.bib26))
    2). Prefix-based methods prepend a "system prompts" instead to bypass the build-in
    safety mechanism (Liu et al., [2023](#bib.bib18); Huang et al., [2023](#bib.bib10)).
    For instance, AutoDAN-a (Liu et al., [2023](#bib.bib18)) searches for the optimal
    system prompt using a genetic algorithm. 3). Hybrid methods insert several tokens
    to let the harmful prompts be surrounded with benign contexts ("scenarios")  (Yu
    et al., [2023](#bib.bib39); Li et al., [2023](#bib.bib17); Ding et al., [2023](#bib.bib6);

    jailbreak open-source and close-source LLMs with a high success rate and conduct
    a detailed ablation study to analyze the proposed algorithm. The high attack success

- en: In conclusion, this paper successfully demonstrates a novel approach to automating
    jailbreaking attacks on LLMs through the prompt decomposition and reconstruction
    of original prompts. Our findings reveal that by embedding malicious content within
    phrases, the proposed attack framework, DrAttack, significantly reduces iteration
    time overhead and achieves higher attack success rates. Through rigorous analysis,
    we have evaluated the performance of leading LLMs, including GPTs, Gemini-Pro,
    and the Llama-2-chat series, under various prompt types, highlighting their vulnerabilities
    to DrAttack. Moreover, we demonstrate prompt decomposition and ICL reconstruction
    to conceal malice in harmful prompts while keeping faithfulness to responses from
    uncensored LLMs. Our assessment of current defense mechanisms employed by these
    models underscores a critical gap in their ability to thwart generalized attacks
    like those generated by DrAttack. This vulnerability indicates an urgent need
    for more robust and effective defensive strategies in the LLM domain. Our research
    highlights the effectiveness of using prompt decomposition and reconstruction
    to challenge LLMs. We hope that this insight inspires more research and innovation
    in LLMs.

    Models (LLMs) through prompt decomposition and reconstruction. While the primary
    focus is on understanding and exposing vulnerabilities within LLMs, it is crucial
    to consider the dual-use nature of such findings. This work demonstrates the ease
    with which LLMs can be manipulated, raising essential questions about their security
    in real-world applications. Our intention is to prompt the development of more
    robust defenses against such vulnerabilities, thereby contributing to LLMs’ overall
    resilience and reliability.

    demonstrated could be leveraged by malicious actors to bypass safeguards in LLMs,
    leading to unethical or harmful applications. Despite the potential risk, the
    technique is simple to implement and may be ultimately discovered by any malicious
    attackers, so disclosing this technique is essential for developing defensive
    mechanisms to improve the safety of current LLM systems. We aim to foster a community-wide
    effort towards more secure and responsible AI development by highlighting these

    adversarial attack sentences. The parsing tree is constructed to dissect the original
    adversarial sentence into its grammatical components, facilitating the decomposition
    of the prompt into manageable sub-parts. The types of words identified in this
    process are listed in [Section A.1](#A1.SS1.SSS0.Px1 "Phrasing process in decomposition
    ‣ A.1 Algorithm details ‣ Appendix A Appendix ‣ DrAttack: Prompt Decomposition
    and Reconstruction Makes Powerful LLM Jailbreakers"). Words within the same category
    are strategically combined at adjacent levels to form coherent sub-prompts, ensuring
    each part retains its semantic integrity for effective reconstruction. To streamline
    this information, we categorize these words into three main groups: [structure],
    [verb], and [noun] to align with their grammatical roles, enabling a more systematic
    approach to prompt decomposition and reconstruction. The mapping from words to
    categories is provided in [Section A.1](#A1.SS1.SSS0.Px1 "Phrasing process in
    decomposition ‣ A.1 Algorithm details ‣ Appendix A Appendix ‣ DrAttack: Prompt

    ‣ DrAttack: Prompt Decomposition and Reconstruction Makes Powerful LLM Jailbreakers"),
    strategically combine words of the same category at adjacent levels to form sub-prompts.
    Identifying and labeling the highest-level sub-prompt as [instruction] are crucial,
    as they encapsulate the core directive of the prompt, significantly influencing
    the success of ICL reconstruction and the formation of the STRUCTURE.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'To effectively utilize in-context learning (ICL) for prompt reconstruction,
    it’s crucial to create harmless prompts that retain high similarity to the original
    harmful ones. This similarity ensures that the responses from large language models
    (LLMs) have a structurally comparable output, essential for successful ICL reconstruction.
    However, the challenge lies in balancing ’harmlessness’—ensuring prompts do not
    generate inappropriate content—with ’similarity’—maintaining enough of the original
    structure to elicit comparable responses from LLMs. Our approach addresses this
    challenge by using a minimal number of replaceable sub-prompts, specifically targeting
    those elements that can be altered without significantly changing the overall
    structures to query GPT models. We resort to GPT to do replacement. In this process,
    we target [verbs] and [nouns] in the prompts for potential replacement. Our goal
    is to select replacements that maintain the essential meaning and format of the
    original prompt. We instruct GPT to limit the number of changes it makes because
    every modification might affect how effective the prompt is in getting structurally
    sound and contextually appropriate responses. This careful approach is crucial
    for maintaining the effectiveness of ICL, which depends significantly on the structural
    integrity of the prompts to guide the learning model’s response generation. The
    query is shown in [Figure 10](#A1.F10 "In Related automation prompt templates

    To balance efficient attacks and faithful responses, we adopt a level-wise random
    search on synonyms. This search begins with the lowest-level sub-prompts in the
    parsing tree and is only done to [verb] and [noun], whose combinations usually
    form malice. Starting from low-level substitutions, we aim to preserve the overall
    semantics of the main sentence to the greatest extent possible. By querying OpenAI’s
    GPT to construct synonym search space (Wang et al., [2023](#bib.bib32)), we generate

    following other works (Zou et al., [2023](#bib.bib42)). Word games are integrated
    into the prompt to add an additional layer of obfuscation. By redefining words
    within the [noun] sub-prompts, we create a playful context that disguises the
    prompt’s harmful intentions. This technique is especially effective with LLMs
    like Llama2, designed to align closely with human language patterns, making them
    more susceptible to creative linguistic manipulations like word games. Specifically,
    we apply these word games only to the [noun] sub-prompts, which further obscure
    any malicious intent. The word game begins by playfully instructing the LLM to
    reinterpret certain words, establishing a context where words take on different
    meanings. The adversarial prompt then strategically incorporates these reinterpreted
    words, blending seamlessly with the word game context. A word game is first presented
    to the target LLM to execute this. This is followed by delivering the adversarial
    prompt, where words have been strategically replaced to conceal malice. The prompt

- en: In this paper, we present an automatic prompt decomposition and reconstruction
    algorithm method for concealing malice in malicious prompts, which adversaries
    could exploit to launch attacks on LLMs. However, our work, similar to previous
    jailbreak studies, is not intended to cause harm. Our study aims to exploit the
    vulnerabilities of LLMs when the prompting strategies conceal malice. By identifying
    these security vulnerabilities, we hope to contribute to efforts to protect LLMs
    from similar attacks, making them more robust for broader applications and user
    communities.
