- en: 'Large language models (LLMs) are vulnerable to adversarial attacks that add
    malicious tokens to an input prompt to bypass the safety guardrails of an LLM
    and cause it to produce harmful content. In this work, we introduce erase-and-check,
    the first framework for defending against adversarial prompts with certifiable
    safety guarantees. Given a prompt, our procedure erases tokens individually and
    inspects the resulting subsequences using a safety filter. It labels the input
    prompt as harmful if any of the subsequences or the prompt itself is detected
    as harmful by the filter. Our safety certificate guarantees that harmful prompts
    are not mislabeled as safe due to an adversarial attack up to a certain size.
    We implement the safety filter in two ways, using Llama 2 and DistilBERT, and
    compare the performance of erase-and-check for the two cases. We defend against
    three attack modes: i) adversarial suffix, where an adversarial sequence is appended
    at the end of a harmful prompt; ii) adversarial insertion, where the adversarial
    sequence is inserted anywhere in the middle of the prompt; and iii) adversarial
    infusion, where adversarial tokens are inserted at arbitrary positions in the
    prompt, not necessarily as a contiguous block.'

- en: 'Our experimental results demonstrate that this procedure can obtain strong
    certified safety guarantees on harmful prompts while maintaining good empirical
    performance on safe prompts. For example, against adversarial suffixes of length 20,
    the Llama 2-based implementation of erase-and-check certifiably detects $92\%$
    of safe prompts correctly. These values are even higher for the DistilBERT-based
    implementation. Additionally, we propose three efficient empirical defenses: i)
    RandEC, a randomized subsampling version of erase-and-check; ii) GreedyEC, which
    greedily erases tokens that maximize the softmax score of the harmful class; and
    iii) GradEC, which uses gradient information to optimize tokens to erase. We demonstrate
    their effectiveness against adversarial prompts generated by the Greedy Coordinate
    Gradient (GCG) attack algorithm. The code for our experiments is available at:

- en: Popular language models such as ChatGPT, Gemini, and Llama are often trained
    using unvetted textual data from the web that contain significant amounts of inappropriate
    and objectionable material. A model trained on such data can produce harmful content,
    making it unsuitable for public use. Furthermore, as language models improve over
    time, they become better at following user instructions, including those from
    malicious actors intended to cause harm. To this end, several fine-tuning techniques
    have been developed to incorporate human feedback to ensure that LLM outputs are
    safe and aligned with human values [[1](#bib.bib1), [2](#bib.bib2), [3](#bib.bib3),
    [4](#bib.bib4), [5](#bib.bib5)]. These approaches use human oversight to steer
    an LLM to generate safe outputs. When prompted with a harmful user request, an
    aligned model is expected to decline the request, similar to the example below.

    there are several “jailbreak” attacks that allow a malicious user to bypass safety
    measures. For example, Wei et al. [[6](#bib.bib6)] show that simply asking an
    LLM to begin its response with “Absolutely! Here’s…” could mislead the model into
    complying with a harmful request. Several other examples of adversarial augmentation
    of harmful prompts, such as the Do Anything Now (DAN) jailbreak, also exist. More
    recently, the work of Zou et al. [[7](#bib.bib7)] shows that it is possible to
    automate the generation of adversarial sequences, creating an endless supply of
    such attacks, using their Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG) attack. Moreover, a
    single such adversarial sequence could be used for several harmful prompts and
    LLMs. Their method achieves a high attack success rate, of up to 84%, even on

    Jain et al. [[8](#bib.bib8)] and Alon and Kamfonas [[9](#bib.bib9)] study approaches
    such as perplexity filtering, paraphrasing, and adversarial training. Each approach
    targets a specific weakness of adversarial sequences to detect and defend against
    them. For instance, perplexity filtering leverages the gibberish nature of an
    adversarial sequence to distinguish it from the rest of the prompt. However, such
    empirical defenses do not come with performance guarantees and can be broken by
    stronger attacks. For example, AutoDAN attacks developed by Liu et al. [[10](#bib.bib10)]
    and Zhu et al. [[11](#bib.bib11)] can bypass perplexity filters by generating
    natural-looking adversarial sequences. This phenomenon of newer attacks evading
    existing defenses has also been well documented in computer vision [[12](#bib.bib12),
    [13](#bib.bib13), [14](#bib.bib14), [15](#bib.bib15)]. Therefore, it is necessary
    to design defenses with certified performance guarantees that hold even in the
    presence of unseen attacks.

    we prompt a pre-trained language model, Llama 2 [[16](#bib.bib16)], to classify
    text sequences as safe or harmful. This design is easy to use, does not require
    training, and is compatible with proprietary LLMs with API access. We use the
    Llama 2 system prompt to set its objective of classifying input prompts (see Appendix [0.B](#Pt0.A2
    "Appendix 0.B Llama 2 System Prompt ‣ Certifying LLM Safety against Adversarial
    Prompting")). We then look for texts such as “Not harmful” in the model’s response
    to determine whether the prompt is safe. We flag the input prompt as harmful if
    no such text sequence is found in the response. We show that erase-and-check can
    obtain good performance with this implementation of the safety filter, e.g., a
    certified accuracy of 92% on harmful prompts. However, running a large language
    model is computationally expensive and requires significant amounts of processing
    power and storage capacity. Furthermore, since Llama 2 is not specifically trained
    to recognize safe and harmful prompts, its accuracy decreases against longer adversarial
    sequences.'

    may be preferred. Motivated by this, we propose three empirical defenses inspired
    by our certified procedure: i) RandEC, which only checks a random subset of the
    erased subsequences with the safety filter (Section [7.1](#S7.SS1 "7.1 RandEC:

    methods are significantly faster than the original erase-and-check procedure and
    obtain good empirical detection accuracy against adversarial prompts generated
    by the GCG attack algorithm. For example, to achieve an empirical detection accuracy
    of more than 90% on adversarial harmful prompts, RandEC only checks 30% of the
    erased subsequences (0.03 seconds), and GreedyEC only needs nine iterations (0.06
    seconds).³³3Average time per prompt on a single NVIDIA A100 GPU.'

    However, empirical defenses can be broken by stronger attacks; e.g., AutoDAN attacks

    in computer vision [[12](#bib.bib12), [15](#bib.bib15), [32](#bib.bib32)]. Empirical
    robustness against a specific adversarial attack does not imply robustness against

    on the attack mode and remains the same for all modes considered.

    GreedyEC by varying the number of iterations on adversarial suffixes up to 20
    tokens long produced by the GCG attack. When the number of iterations is zero,
    the safety filter is evaluated only on the input prompt, and the GCG attack is
    able to degrade the detection rate to zero with only 12 adversarial tokens. As
    we increase the iterations, the detection performance improves to over $94\%$.
    This shows that the greedy algorithm is able to successfully defend against the
    attack without labeling too many safe promtps as harmful.'

- en: Both RandEC and GreedyEC have pros and cons. RandEC approaches the certified
    performance of erase-and-check on harmful prompts as the sampling ratio increases
    to one. Its performance on safe prompts is also at least as high as that of erase-and-check.
    This cannot be said for GreedyEC, as increasing its iterations need not make it
    tend to the certified procedure. However, GreedyEC does not depend on the attack
    mode and could be more suitable for scenarios where the attack mode is not known.
    The running time of GreedyEC grows as $O(\kappa n)$ is the number of iterations,
    which is significantly better than that of erase-and-check in the insertion and
    infusion modes.

    all harmful prompts as such. We vary the number of iterations of the optimizer

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While erase-and-check can obtain certified safety guarantees on harmful prompts,
    its main limitation is its running time. The number of erased subsequences increases
    rapidly for general attack modes like infusion, making it infeasible for long
    adversarial sequences. Furthermore, the accuracy of erase-and-check on safe prompts
    decreases for larger erase lengths, especially with Llama 2, as it needs to check
    more subsequences for each input prompt, increasing the likelihood of misclassification.
    As we show in our work, both of these issues can be partially resolved by using
    a text classifier trained on examples of safe and harmful prompts as the safety
    filter. Nevertheless, this classifier does not achieve perfect accuracy, and our
    procedure may sometimes incorrectly label a prompt.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We propose a framework to certify the safety of large language models against
    adversarial prompting. Our approach produces verifiable guarantees of detecting
    harmful prompts altered with adversarial sequences up to a defined length. We
    experimentally demonstrate that our procedure can obtain high certified accuracy
    on harmful prompts while maintaining good empirical performance on safe prompts.
    We demonstrate its adaptability by defending against three different adversarial
    threat models of varying strengths. Additionally, we propose three empirical defenses
    inspired by our certified method and show that they perform well in practice.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Our preliminary results on certifying LLM safety indicate a promising direction
    for improving language model safety with verifiable guarantees. There are several
    potential directions in which this work could be taken forward. One could study
    certificates for more general threat models that allow changes in the harmful
    prompt $P$. Another interesting direction could be to improve the efficiency of
    erase-and-check by reducing the number of safety filter evaluations. Furthermore,
    our certification framework could potentially be extended beyond LLM safety to
    other critical domains such as privacy and fairness.
  prefs: []

    initiate a deeper exploration into the robustness of safety measures needed for
    the responsible deployment of language models. Our work underscores the potential
    for certified defenses against adversarial prompting of LLMs, and we hope that
    our contributions will help drive future research in this field.

    adversarial prompts with certifiable safety guarantees. Additionally, we propose
    three efficient empirical defenses: RandEC, GreedyEC, and GradEC. Our methods
    can be applied across various real-world applications to ensure that Large Language
    Models (LLMs) do not produce harmful content. This is critical because disseminating
    harmful content (e.g., instructions for building a bomb), especially to malicious
    entities, could have catastrophic consequences in the real world. Our approaches
    are specifically designed to defend against adversarial attacks that could bypass
    the existing safety measures of state-of-the-art LLMs. Defenses, such as ours,
    are critical in today’s world, where LLMs have become major sources of information
    for the general public.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While the scope of our work is to develop novel methods that can defend against
    adversarial jailbreak attacks on LLMs, it is important to be aware of the fact
    that our methods may be error-prone, just like any other algorithm. For instance,
    our erase-and-check procedure (with Llama 2 as the safety filter) is capable of
    detecting harmful messages with 92% accuracy, which in turn implies that the method
    is ineffective the remaining 8% of the time. Secondly, while our empirical defenses
    (e.g., RandEC and GreedyEC) are efficient approximations of the erase-and-check
    procedure, their detection rates are slightly lower in comparison. It is important
    to be mindful of this trade-off when choosing between our methods. Lastly, the
    efficacy of our methods depends on the efficacy of the safety classifier used.
    So, it is critical to account for this when employing our approaches in practice.

    against adversarial jailbreak attacks, has the potential to have a significant
    positive impact on a variety of real-world applications. That said, it is important
    to exercise appropriate caution and be cognizant of the aforementioned aspects
    when using our methods.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'A: No. To compute the certified performance guarantees of our erase-and-check
    procedure, we only need to evaluate the safety filter is-harmful on *clean* harmful
    prompts, i.e., harmful prompts without the adversarial sequence. Theorem [4.1](#S4.Thmtheorem1
    "Theorem 4.1 (Safety Certificate). ‣ 4 Adversarial Suffix ‣ Certifying LLM Safety
    against Adversarial Prompting") guarantees that the accuracy of is-harmful on
    the clean harmful prompts is a lower bound on the accuracy of erase-and-check
    under adversarial attacks of bounded size. The certified accuracy is independent
    of the algorithm used to generate the adversarial prompts.'

    one we construct using Llama 2. In the probabilistic case, the probability with
    which the filter detects a harmful prompt $P$ as harmful. Using this fact, we
    can directly certify the expected accuracy of our procedure over a distribution

    and fine-tune it on our safety dataset. DistilBERT is a faster and lightweight
    version of the BERT language model [[49](#bib.bib49)]. We split the 520 examples
    in each class into 400 training examples and 120 test examples. For safe prompts,
    we include erased subsequences of the original prompts for the corresponding attack
    mode. For example, when training a safety classifier for the suffix mode, subsequences
    are created by erasing suffixes of different lengths from the safe prompts. Similarly,
    for insertion and infusion modes, we include subsequences created by erasing contiguous
    sequences and subsets of tokens (of size at most 3), respectively, from the safe
    prompts. This helps train the model to recognize erased versions of safe prompts
    as safe, too. However, we do not perform this step for harmful prompts as subsequences
    of harmful prompts need not be harmful. We use the test examples to evaluate the
    performance of erase-and-check with the trained classifier as the safety filter.

    The addition of the erased subsequences significantly increases the number of
    safe examples in the training set, resulting in a class imbalance. To deal with
    this, we use class-balancing strategies such as using different weights for each
    class and extending the smaller class (harmful prompts) by repeating existing
    examples.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Provable robustness techniques have been extensively studied in the machine
    learning literature. They seek to guarantee that a model achieves a certain performance
    under adversarial attacks up to a specific size. For image classification models,
    robustness certificates have been developed that guarantee that the prediction
    remains unchanged in the neighborhood of the input (say, within an $\ell_{2}$-norm
    ball of radius 0.1). Among the existing certifiable methods, randomized smoothing
    has emerged as the most successful in terms of scalability and adaptability. It
    evaluates the model on several noisy samples of the input and outputs the class
    predicted by a majority of the samples. This method works well for high-dimensional
    inputs such as ImageNet images [[42](#bib.bib42), [41](#bib.bib41)] and adapts
    to several machine learning settings such as reinforcement learning [[51](#bib.bib51),
    [52](#bib.bib52)], streaming models [[53](#bib.bib53)] and structured outputs
    such as segmentation masks [[54](#bib.bib54), [55](#bib.bib55)]. However, existing
    techniques do not seek to certify the safety of a model. Our erase-and-check framework
    is designed to leverage the unique advantages of defending against safety attacks,
    enabling it to obtain better certified guarantees than existing techniques.
  prefs: []

- en: In this section, we compare our safety certificate with that of randomized smoothing.
    We adapt randomized smoothing for adversarial suffix attacks and show that even
    the best possible safety guarantees that this approach can obtain are significantly
    lower than ours. Given a prompt $P$ as the size of the noise added. Note that
    since we evaluate the safety filter on all possible noisy samples, the above procedure
    is actually deterministic, which only makes the certificate better.

- en: The main weakness of the smoothing-based procedure compared to our erase-and-check
    framework is that it requires a majority of the checked sequences to be labeled
    as harmful. This significantly restricts the size of the adversarial suffix it
    can certify. In the following theorem, we put an upper bound on the length of
    the largest adversarial suffix $\overline{|\alpha|}$ that could possibly be certified
    using the smoothing approach. Note that this bound is not the actual certified
    length but an upper bound on that length, which means that adversarial suffixes
    longer than this bound cannot be guaranteed to be labeled as harmful by the smoothing-based
    procedure described above.

    length of 6. The average running times are reported for a single NVIDIA A100 GPU.
    Note that the maximum erase length for two insertions is on individual adversarial
    sequences. Thus, if this number is 6, the maximum number of tokens that can be
    erased is 12. Since the number of erased subsequences for two insertions is significantly
    higher than that for one insertion, the empirical accuracy decreases, and the
    running time increases much faster than for one insertion. Defending against multiple
    insertions is significantly more challenging, as the set of adversarial prompts
    increases exponentially with the number of adversarial insertions $k$.
