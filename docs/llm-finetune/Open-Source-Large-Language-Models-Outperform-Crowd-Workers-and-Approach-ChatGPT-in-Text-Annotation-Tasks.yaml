- en: This study examines the performance of open-source Large Language Models (LLMs)
    in text annotation tasks and compares it with proprietary models like ChatGPT
    and human-based services such as MTurk. While prior research demonstrated the
    high performance of ChatGPT across numerous NLP tasks, open-source LLMs like HugginChat
    and FLAN are gaining attention for their cost-effectiveness, transparency, reproducibility,
    and superior data protection. We assess these models using both zero-shot and
    few-shot approaches and different temperature parameters across a range of text
    annotation tasks. Our findings show that while ChatGPT achieves the best performance
    in most tasks, open-source LLMs not only outperform MTurk but also demonstrate
    competitive potential against ChatGPT in specific tasks.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Generative Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-3 and GPT-4 have demonstrated
    substantial potential for text-annotation tasks common to many Natural Language
    Processing (NLP) applications (Ding et al., [2023](#bib.bib5)). Recent research
    reports impressive performance metrics for these models. For instance, studies
    demonstrate that ChatGPT exceeds the performance of crowd-workers in tasks encompassing
    relevance, stance, sentiment, topic identification, and frame detection (Gilardi,
    Alizadeh and Kubli, [2023](#bib.bib6)), that it outperforms trained annotators
    in detecting the political party affiliations of Twitter users (Törnberg, [2023](#bib.bib13)),
    and that it achieves accuracy scores over 0.6 for tasks such as stance, sentiment,
    hate speech detection, and bot identification (Zhu et al., [2023](#bib.bib16)).
    Notably, ChatGPT also demonstrates the ability to correctly classify more than
    70% of news as either true or false (Hoes, Altay and Bermeo, [2023](#bib.bib7)),
    which suggests that LLMs might potentially be used to assist content moderation
    processes.

- en: While the performance of LLMs for text annotation is promising, there are several
    aspects that remain unclear and require further research. Among these is the impact
    of different approaches such as zero-shot versus few-shot learning and settings
    such as varying temperature parameters. Zero-shot learning allows models to predict
    for unseen tasks, while few-shot learning uses a small number of examples to generalize
    to new tasks. The conditions under which one approach outperforms the other are
    not fully understood yet. Furthermore, the temperature parameter determines the
    randomness in a model’s outputs. Identifying the optimal temperature for different
    tasks is still a topic of ongoing research.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Moreover, the role of open-source LLMs deserves more attention. While models
    like ChatGPT have democratized the field by offering a more cost-effective alternative
    to traditionally more expensive annotation methods involving human annotations,
    open-source LLMs represent a further step towards greater accessibility. Beyond
    cost, the advantages of open-source LLMs include degrees of transparency and reproducibility
    that are typically not provided by commercial models. open-source LLMs can be
    scrutinized, tailored, and enhanced by a wider user base, fostering a diverse
    group of contributors and improving the overall quality and fairness of the models.
    Furthermore, open-source LLMs offer significant data protection benefits. They
    are designed not to share data with third parties, enhancing security and confidentiality.
    For these reasons, the academic community is increasingly advocating for the use
    of open-source LLMs (Spirling, [2023](#bib.bib12)). This transition would not
    only broaden access to these tools for researchers, but also promote a more open
    and reproducible research culture.

    and Kubli, [2023](#bib.bib6)) to compare the performance of two widely-used open-source
    LLMs, HugginChat and FLAN, with that of ChatGPT as well as MTurk, using eleven
    text annotation tasks distributed across four datasets. Each model is tested using
    different settings: varied model sizes for FLAN, and distinct temperature parameters
    in both zero-shot and few-shot approaches for ChatGPT and HuggingChat. We then
    compare their accuracy, using agreement with trained annotators as a metric, against
    that of MTurk as well as amongst themselves. While our previous research (Gilardi,
    Alizadeh and Kubli, [2023](#bib.bib6)) showed that ChatGPT outperforms MTurk in
    almost all tasks, our new results reveal that open-source LLMs surpass MTurk in
    the majority of tasks. When considering the top-performing models, open-source
    LLMs outperform ChatGPT in certain tasks and approach its performance in others,
    demonstrating their potential. Furthermore, the comparison of models using different
    temperature settings and zero vs. few-shot prompts shows that, for both ChatGPT
    and open-source LLMs, there is no particular approach that uniformly maximizes
    performance. Given these findings, further research is warranted to optimize the
    use of diverse settings and prompts under different circumstances.'

    zero-shot annotation performance with that of MTurk (Gilardi, Alizadeh and Kubli,
    [2023](#bib.bib6)). We rely on the same datasets (n = 6,183), which include tweets
    and news articles that we collected and annotated manually for another study on
    the discourse around content moderation (Alizadeh et al., [2022](#bib.bib2)),
    as well as a new sample of tweets posted in 2023 to address the concern that LLMs
    might be merely reproducing texts that could have been part of their training
    data. While our previous study focused on ChatGPT, our analysis conducts the same
    classifications using two open-source LLMs (HugginChat and FLAN), using the same
    codebook that we originally constructed for our research assistants and which
    we previously used for ChatGPT and MTurk (see Appendix [S2](#A2 "Appendix S2 Zero-Shot
    Annotation Codebook ‣ Open-Source Large Language Models Outperform Crowd Workers
    and Approach ChatGPT in Text-Annotation Tasks")). Moreover, in this paper we extend
    our analysis to include few-shot learning for all models, including ChatGPT. The
    corresponding prompts are shown in Appendix [S3](#A3 "Appendix S3 Few-Shot Annotation
    Codebook (Chain-of-Thought) ‣ Open-Source Large Language Models Outperform Crowd
    Workers and Approach ChatGPT in Text-Annotation Tasks"). Specifically, for ChatGPT
    and HuggingChat, we conducted sixteen sets of annotations for each text, specifically
    two runs for each combination of two temperature levels, zero-shot, and few-shot.
    For FLAN, we conducted twelve sets of annotations, namely, two runs for three
    different model sizes, both zero-shot and few-shot (L, XL, XXL). More particularly,
    to explore the effect of ChatGPT’s and HugginChat’s temperature parameters, which
    controls the degree of randomness of the output, we conducted the annotations
    with default values (1 for ChatGPT and 0.9 for HuggingChat) as well as with a
    value of 0.2, which implies less randomness. We conducted two sets of annotations
    for each temperature value to compute LLM’s intercoder agreement. Finally, for
    each combination of LLM and parameter setting, we conduct chain of thought (CoT)
    prompting (Wei et al., [2022](#bib.bib15)). This few-shot approach involves providing
    LLMs with question and step-by-step reasoning answer examples.

    can lead to top performance. For HuggingChat, lower temperature settings typically
    result in better performance, though few-shot models do not always outperform
    zero-shot ones. Lastly, for FLAN, larger models do not consistently outperform
    smaller ones. (Note that only zero-shot classifications were tested with FLAN.)

    a competitive alternative for text annotation tasks, exhibiting performance metrics
    that generally exceed those of MTurk and rival those of ChatGPT. For certain tasks,
    these open-source LLMs are found to be an adequate substitute for crowd-annotations,
    and in some instances, their top-performing models approach or even exceed the
    performance of ChatGPT.

    advantages. While ChatGPT provides substantial cost-efficiency, being about thirty
    times more affordable per annotation compared to MTurk (Gilardi, Alizadeh and Kubli,
    [2023](#bib.bib6)), open-source LLMs surpass this by being freely available. This
    constitutes a significant improvement in the accessibility of such models, extending
    their reach to a broader range of researchers irrespective of financial constraints.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Open-source LLMs present benefits that go beyond cost-efficiency. One key advantage
    is that they help reduce reliance on proprietary models operated by for-profit
    companies, which may conflict with research ethics and the reproducibility standards
    (Spirling, [2023](#bib.bib12)). Furthermore, open-source LLMs provide distinct
    benefits for data protection, as they are designed in such a way that data do
    not need to be shared with any third-party entities (Van Dis et al., [2023](#bib.bib14)).
    This feature ensures that sensitive information remains secure and confidential,
    because it not sent to or stored by an external party. The elimination of data
    sharing in open-source LLMs provides an extra layer of protection against potential
    data breaches or unauthorized access. This feature becomes especially beneficial
    in scenarios where sensitive data is involved, such as in the legal or medical
    fields, where confidentiality is of utmost importance (Ray, [2023](#bib.bib11);
    Paul et al., [2023](#bib.bib10); Murdoch, [2021](#bib.bib9)), but also in social
    science research involving data protected under the European Union’s General Data
    Protection Regulation (GDPR), or covered by non-disclosure agreements (NDAs).

    error analysis is needed to identify areas of underperformance and potential biases
    across these models. A better understanding of these shortcomings will help refine
    these tools and address their limitations. Second, the relationship between model
    settings and task-specific performance needs to be further explored. The findings
    indicate that optimal performance may depend on the specific interplay of parameters
    such as temperature and model size, as well as the choice between zero-shot and
    few-shot approaches. Given the variable performance of these models under different
    settings, it is important to identify which combinations yield the best results
    for specific tasks.

    as a practical alternative for text annotation tasks. The models’ performance,
    coupled with their cost, accessibility, and data-protection advantages, position
    them as valuable tools in the domain of natural language processing. However,
    additional research is needed to optimize their performance and ensure their effective
    application across various use cases.

    variations, we decided to feed tweets one by one to ChatGPT using the following
    prompt: “Here’s the tweet I picked, please label it as [Task Specific Instruction
    (e.g. ‘one of the topics in the instruction’)].” The corresponding prompts for
    each task are reported in Appendix [S3](#A3 "Appendix S3 Few-Shot Annotation Codebook
    (Chain-of-Thought) ‣ Open-Source Large Language Models Outperform Crowd Workers
    and Approach ChatGPT in Text-Annotation Tasks"). For few-shot tests, we employ
    Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting (Wei et al., [2022](#bib.bib15)), where large
    language models (LLMs) are provided with both the question and a step-by-step
    reasoning answer as examples. Specifically, following previous research (Kojima
    et al., [2022](#bib.bib8)), we use ChatGPT to generate two CoT prompted examples
    per class per annotation task. More particularly, we feed ChatGPT with our human-annotated
    examples and ask it to annotate the example and provide explanations for the annotation.
    If the ChatGPT’s annotation was correct (which we know thanks to our human annotations),
    we included the example along with the ChatGPT’s explanation in our prompt for
    the few-shot experiment.'

    that is, the number of correctly classified instances over the total number of
    cases to be classified, using trained human annotations as our gold standard and
    considering only texts that both annotators agreed upon. Second, we computed intercoder
    agreement, measured as the percentage of instances for which both annotators in
    a given group report the same class.

    posted by users on social media sites to determine if the content should be published
    or not, based on specific rules and guidelines. In the context of content moderation,
    Section 230 is a law in the United States that protects websites and other online
    platforms from being held legally responsible for the content posted by their
    users. This means that if someone posts something illegal or harmful on a website,
    the website itself cannot be sued for allowing it to be posted. However, websites
    can still choose to moderate content and remove anything that violates their own
    policies.

    sites that deplatformed former President Donald Trump narrowly cleared a Senate
    committee Monday and soon will be ready for a full vote in the Legislature. Sen.
    Jeff Brandes, R-St. Petersburg, was the lone Republican who argued against the
    proposal by fellow Republican Sen. Ray Rodrigues of Naples. Brandes labeled it
    a "big government bill." "This Senate is currently filled with small government
    Republicans who do believe that government shouldn’t be in the lives of businesses,"
    Brandes said. He added: "This is the exact opposite of the things that we stand
    for." But Rodrigues argued back that the measure doesn’t defy free market principles.
    The bill (SB 7072) orders social media companies to publish standards with detailed
    definitions of when someone would be censored or blocked, and makes companies
    subject to as much as $100,000 fines for deplatforming a Florida candidate. "I’m
    bringing you good policy supported by your constituents," Rodrigues said. The
    measure was approved 10-9 by the Appropriations Committee, its last stop before
    going to the Senate floor. A similar measure is ready for a full House vote. State
    and federal courts have generally taken a hands-off view involving regulating
    online platforms. Congress also has not'

- en: 'Answer: Based on the provided text, it can be classified as describing content
    moderation as a PROBLEM. The text highlights the debate and disagreement surrounding
    a proposed bill that aims to punish social media sites for deplatforming former
    President Donald Trump. Senator Jeff Brandes argues against the proposal, labeling
    it a "big government bill" and stating that it goes against the principles of
    small government Republicans. This indicates a negative view of content moderation,
    particularly in terms of government intervention and potential restrictions on
    businesses. While Senator Ray Rodrigues argues in favor of the bill, the emphasis
    in the text is on the opposition and criticism, suggesting a portrayal of content
    moderation as a problem.'

    Rick Wilson apologises for running late for our phone interview: it’s been a frantic
    morning for the veteran Republican ad-maker and his colleagues at the Lincoln
    Project. The anti-Trump group has just released its latest advertisement, slamming
    the US President for suggesting that the November 3 election may need to be delayed.
    In the half hour since the ad ??? titled We Will Vote ??? went live, it has already
    racked up more than 250,000 views online. That’s nothing unusual for the operatives
    at the Lincoln Project, who have been pumping out attack ads at a prolific rate
    over recent months. "We push really fast all the time," Wilson says. "We drive
    ourselves and our team very hard because we think we are pursuing a worthwhile
    endeavour and we know it works." The group’s co-founders include Steve Schmidt,
    who ran Republican nominee John McCain’s 2008 campaign, and conservative lawyer
    George Conway, the husband of top Trump aide Kellyanne Conway. Having spent most
    of their adult lives working to get Republicans elected, they are now producing
