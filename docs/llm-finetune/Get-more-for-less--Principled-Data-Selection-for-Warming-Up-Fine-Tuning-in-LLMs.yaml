- en: 'This work focuses on leveraging and selecting from vast, unlabeled, open data
    to *pre-fine-tune* a pre-trained language model. The goal is to minimize the need
    for costly domain-specific data for subsequent fine-tuning while achieving desired
    performance levels. While many data selection algorithms have been designed for
    small-scale applications, rendering them unsuitable for our context, some emerging
    methods do cater to language data scales. However, they often prioritize data
    that aligns with the target distribution. While this strategy may be effective
    when training a model from scratch, it can yield limited results when the model
    has already been pre-trained on a different distribution. Differing from prior
    work, our key idea is to select data that nudges the pre-training distribution
    closer to the target distribution. We show the optimality of this approach for
    fine-tuning tasks under certain conditions. We demonstrate the efficacy of our
    methodology across a diverse array of tasks (NLU, NLG, zero-shot) with models
    up to 2.7B, showing that it consistently surpasses other selection methods. Moreover,
    our proposed method is significantly faster than existing techniques, scaling
    to millions of samples within a single GPU hour. Our code is open-sourced ¹¹1Code
    repository: [https://anonymous.4open.science/r/DV4LLM-D761/](https://anonymous.4open.science/r/DV4LLM-D761/).
    While fine-tuning offers significant potential for enhancing performance across
    diverse tasks, its associated costs often limit its widespread adoption; with
    this work, we hope to lay the groundwork for cost-effective fine-tuning, making
    its benefits more accessible.'

    [2023](#bib.bib75); Wang et al., [2022b](#bib.bib81)). Often, adapting these models
    to specific applications necessitates further fine-tuning. A persistent challenge
    in this process is the emergence of new, timely tasks for which curated datasets
    are sparse. For example, GPT models have been flagged for safety-related issues (Wang

    interventions. While expert-annotated safety datasets would provide an ideal solution,

    as illustrated in Fig. [2](#S1.F2 "Figure 2 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Get more for less:
    Principled Data Selection for Warming Up Fine-Tuning in LLMs"), is to first extract
    relevant samples from the vast pool of open, unlabeled data and fine-tune the
    pre-trained model on these samples. We term this initial step *pre-fine-tuning*.
    Then, the pre-fine-tuned model undergoes further fine-tuning with any existing
    curated, task-specific samples, which we refer to as the *targeted fine-tuning*
    stage. This two-stage fine-tuning approach aims to harness the potential of relevant
    samples from vast, unlabled open datasets (illustrated in Fig. [1](#S1.F1 "Figure

    for Data Selection), a scalable data selection strategy tailored for pre-fine-tuning.
    Our key idea is to prioritize samples that most effectively shift the pre-training
    distribution closer to the target data distribution. Intuitively, fine-tuning
    a pre-trained model with such samples would boost its performance on the target
    dataset. We prove the validity of this intuition under certain assumptions, thereby
    setting our method on a solid theoretical foundation. While the exact pre-training
    dataset is not always accessible, it is widely recognized that LLMs mainly utilize
    common open sources for pre-training (Touvron et al., [2023](#bib.bib75); Liu
    et al., [2019b](#bib.bib52)). Hence, we can leverage these sources to form a *candidate
    dataset* as a proxy for the pre-training distribution.

    Theoretical results exist that give formal guarantees for distributional distances

    performance (Redko et al., [2020](#bib.bib66)). From an analytical perspective,
    OT enjoys advantages (is a valid metric; compatible with sparse-support distributions;
    stable with respect to deformations of the distributions’ supports (Genevay et al.,

    the model is often trained to converge on the training samples and attain a near-zero
    training loss, i.e., $\mathbb{E}_{x\sim\mu_{t}}[\mathcal{L}(M^{*},x)]\rightarrow
    0$, should also minimize the validation loss in expectation. It is worth noting
    that similar results can be established for other distance metrics (Redko et al.,
    [2020](#bib.bib66)). Thus, in principle, one could also minimize the distributional
    distance between training and validation based on other metrics to select data.
    In fact, this “distribution matching” idea has been the backbone for several lines
    of research (Pham et al., [2020](#bib.bib63); Everaert & Potts, [2023](#bib.bib22)).

- en: The aforementioned “distribution matching” idea is reasonable in its own standing,
    though, it does not directly apply to fine-tuning problems. This idea relies on
    an implicit assumption that the model, when trained, will converge on the selected
    data set, reflecting its underlying distribution and, consequently, attaining
    minimal loss on that distribution. This assumption is plausible for training from
    scratch. However, in the case of fine-tuning LLMs with data far less than pre-training
    data, the best performance on the target distribution is often achieved with as
    few as a single epoch and a small learning rate (Liu et al., [2019b](#bib.bib52)).
    The loss of fine-tuning data often remains away from zero at the time of completion
    and the fine-tuned model actually reflects a distribution that is a weighted combination
    of both pre-training and fine-tuning data. We formalize it as the following lemma.

    Up Fine-Tuning in LLMs"), in both settings our method consistently outperforms
    other data selection methods in average performance and improves over the vanilla
    BERT models by $1.04\%$ gains for RTE, where initial performances on vanilla BERT
    models are considerably lower than those of other tasks. Since other tasks already
    gain high performance on the vanilla model, there is not much place for gains,
    even if more fine-tuning data is provided. Whereas tasks with initial low performance
    (blue) allow fine-tuning to achieve more improvements. Additionally, our method
    consistently beats other methods by achieving a higher average GLUE score. The
    reason is that in our computation for data selection, we include additional information
    on the pretraining data, which allows for a more informed data selection for each
    specific task. On the other hand, the other methods find data points by directly
    matching the task distribution without the additional information on the data
    distribution used in the pretrained model, which may affect the task performance.
    Our approach GOT-D establishes a consistent margin on the average GLUE scores
    over various settings, demonstrating a more suitable data selection method for
    improving performances on these tasks. As demonstrated in Table [4](#S3.T4 "Table
    4 ‣ 3.3 Task-adaption without a pre-defined domain ‣ 3 Evaluation ‣ Get more for
    less: Principled Data Selection for Warming Up Fine-Tuning in LLMs") Upper, in

    data for improving the task adaption performance. We highlighted the limitations
    of traditional data selection methods in the context of pre-fine-tuning and proposed
    a new, principled approach (GOT-D ) that effectively shifts the pre-training distribution
    towards the target distribution, rather than just aligning with the target. We
    showcased the superiority of our method both in terms of performance across various
    tasks and its speed, capable of scaling to millions of samples efficiently.

    even larger than the pre-training data. For these settings, the scale of data
    selection budget ranges from millions to billions of samples. For example, Gururangan
    et al. ([2020](#bib.bib32)) shows that continuing pre-training the model on the
    domain-specific dataset improves its performance on tasks of this domain; Xie
    et al. ([2023](#bib.bib85)) uses importance resampling on simple bi-gram features
    with $10$K bins to select millions of samples for domain/task adaptive pre-training.
    These data selection methods do not fare well in selecting fine-tuning data, which
    typically has a much smaller scale. At selection scales below a million, their
    performance improvements often become marginal. Problem-specific heuristic methods (Chowdhery
    et al., [2022](#bib.bib10)) employ simple criteria to distinguish data quality
    for a given language model on particular datasets. For example, Brown et al. ([2020](#bib.bib7));
    Du et al. ([2022](#bib.bib20)); Gao et al. ([2020](#bib.bib24)) use binary classifiers
    to determine whether the sample is close to “formal text” that is considered higher
    quality. The effectiveness of these methods for data selection is often limited
    to specific use cases and easily fails when migrated to different problems (Xie
    et al., [2023](#bib.bib85)). This type of method typically requires non-trivial
    data-dependent adjustments, and thus orthogonal to our goal of designing automated
    data selection pipelines for general problems.

    It could significantly improve model’s downstream performance (Gururangan et al.,
    [2020](#bib.bib32)), or align its output with human preference (Ouyang et al.,
    [2022](#bib.bib60); Christiano et al., [2017](#bib.bib11)) without needing much
    computing. Efficient methods such as LORA (Hu et al., [2021](#bib.bib36)) allow
    training only a fraction of parameters to effectively update the model on an amount
    of data magnitudes smaller than what is needed to train from scratch. Traditionally,
    selection of fine-tuning samples relies on human curation or simple methods. For
    example, curated-TAPT (TAPT with a curated domain dataset, TAPT/c  (Gururangan
    et al., [2020](#bib.bib32))), a variant of DAPT (Gururangan et al., [2020](#bib.bib32)),
    selects data for task adaptation by finding the nearest neighbors to the target
    task, often ending up selecting a large number of duplicated samples. Despite
    the promising potential, principled methods for selecting fine-tuning data remain
    largely vacant.

- en: A popular approach is to select data by matching distributions where theoretical
    results (widely available from domain adaption) give formal guarantees for distributional
    distances between training and validation data to be a valid proxy for downstream
    model performance (Redko et al., [2020](#bib.bib66)). Xie et al. ([2023](#bib.bib85))
    shows that KL-divergence between the target task and the domain where the models
    are trained highly correlates with the model’s downstream performance while Everaert
    & Potts ([2023](#bib.bib22)) uses iterative gradient methods to prune training
    samples by minimizing KL-divergence. Kang et al. ([2023](#bib.bib40)) uses Optimal
    Transport to directly predict model performance from the composition of training
    data from each source. Pham et al. ([2020](#bib.bib63)) uses unbalanced Optimal
    Transport (UOT) that selects samples from pre-training dataset to augment fine-tuning
    dataset for image classification tasks. These methods are often not scalable to
    select samples from language datasets. Everaert & Potts ([2023](#bib.bib22)) manages
    to apply to $1.5$k samples and thus also relies on clustering. Kang et al. ([2023](#bib.bib40))
    finds the optimal composition for multiple data sources rather than selecting
    samples. Data valuation methods aim to measure the contribution of each sample
    to the model performance, which naturally provides a viable tool for data selection.
    Notable examples includes model-based approaches Shapley (Jia et al., [2019](#bib.bib37);
    Ghorbani & Zou, [2019](#bib.bib29)), LOO (Ghorbani & Zou, [2019](#bib.bib29);
    Koh & Liang, [2017](#bib.bib44)), and model-agnostic methods (Just et al., [2023](#bib.bib39);
    Kwon & Zou, [2023](#bib.bib47)). Achieving fruitful results in their respective
    applications and providing valuable insights, though, these methods are commonly
    known for their scalability issues. Model-based approaches require repetitive
    model training and often struggle to apply to a few thousand samples. A recent
    example, Schoch et al. ([2023](#bib.bib71)) uses a sampling approach to speed
    up a Shapley-style method for selecting data for fine-tuning LLMs and scales up
    to selecting from $7.28$k subsets. It is hardly imaginable to apply it to the
    scale of practical language datasets. Just et al. ([2023](#bib.bib39)) utilizes
    the gradients of an OT problem to provide an efficient measure of data values,
    yet the selection based on gradients does not necessarily align with the target
    distribution, resulting in mediocre performance in general cases. Coresets Borsos
    et al. ([2020](#bib.bib6)); Mirzasoleiman et al. ([2020](#bib.bib58)) aim to find
    a representative subset of samples to speed up the training process, which may
    be formulated as an optimization problem. This process is considerably computationally
    intensive and hard to be applied on a practical scale for language applications.

    $D_{S}$ to measure their relevance to the target task, which is rather simple
    as a small sample will suffice. We then construct a re-sampled candidate dataset
    $D_{S}^{\prime}$ to convert them to some feature space. By downsampling $D_{S}$,
    the computational resource in data selection can be traded for stronger embedding
    schemes, which is especially favorable for delicate tasks. The entire process
    of re-sampling, embedding, and selection can be completed within one hour with
    a single GPU.
