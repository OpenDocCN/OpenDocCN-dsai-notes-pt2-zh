  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) poses challenges in detecting
    and mitigating digital deception, as these models can emulate human conversational
    patterns and facilitate chat-based social engineering (CSE) attacks. This study
    investigates the dual capabilities of LLMs as both facilitators and defenders
    against CSE threats. We develop a novel dataset, SEConvo, simulating CSE scenarios
    in academic and recruitment contexts, and designed to examine how LLMs can be
    exploited in these situations. Our findings reveal that, while off-the-shelf LLMs
    generate high-quality CSE content, their detection capabilities are suboptimal,
    leading to increased operational costs for defense. In response, we propose ConvoSentinel,
    a modular defense pipeline that improves detection at both the message and the
    conversation levels, offering enhanced adaptability and cost-effectiveness. The
    retrieval-augmented module in ConvoSentinel identifies malicious intent by comparing
    messages to a database of similar conversations, enhancing CSE detection at all
    stages. Our study highlights the need for advanced strategies to leverage LLMs
    in cybersecurity. Our code and data are available at [this GitHub repository.](https://github.com/lynneeai/ConvoSentinel.git)

    of human-like dialogue generation, posing significant challenges in detecting
    and mitigating digital deception Schmitt and Flechais ([2023](#bib.bib23)). LLMs,
    with their ability to emulate human conversational patterns, can be exploited
    for nefarious purposes, such as facilitating chat-based social engineering (CSE)
    attacks. These CSE threats transcend traditional phishing emails and websites,
    impacting individuals and businesses alike Sjouwerman ([2023](#bib.bib25)), necessitating
    urgent advances in cybersecurity Tsinganos et al. ([2022](#bib.bib30)).

    prevent these threats Tsinganos et al. ([2022](#bib.bib30), [2023](#bib.bib31),

    cyber-attacks and develop defenses against them Xu et al. ([2024](#bib.bib38));
    Fang et al. ([2024](#bib.bib9)). However, the misuse of LLMs to generate and perpetuate
    CSE attacks remains largely unexplored, leaving us unprepared to address this

    generated using GPT-4 Achiam et al. ([2023](#bib.bib1)), to demonstrate LLMs initiating
    CSE attacks in real-world settings, such as an attacker posing as an academic
    collaborator, recruiter, or journalist. 2) Are LLMs effective detectors of LLM-initiated
    CSE? We evaluate the performance of representative LLMs, such as GPT-4 and Llama2 Touvron

    CSE detection at both message and conversation levels, offering improved adaptability
    and cost-effectiveness. Our approach systematically analyzes conversations, flags
    malicious messages, and consolidates these findings to assess conversation-level
    SE attempts. ConvoSentinel integrates a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) module

    CSE interactions, maintaining lower operational costs than few-shot LLM detectors

    we examine whether LLMs can be utilized to generate high-quality CSE datasets.
    Our study focuses on CSE attempts through LinkedIn reach-outs, a dynamic yet under-explored

    that the generated conversations reflect the instructed intent (malicious or benign),
    we compare the input intent (LLM label) against human annotations. The macro F1
    score is 0.91, showing high accuracy in our generated conversations. Table [2](#S2.T2

    Given the high quality of generated data in reflecting instructed intent, with

    high-quality CSE content, their detection and defense capabilities are inadequate,
    leaving them vulnerable. To address this, we introduce SEConvo, which is, to the

    in realistic social engineering scenarios, serving as a critical testing ground
    for defense mechanisms. Additionally, we propose ConvoSentinel, a modular defense

    Real-world CSE attacks can take various forms and exploit different psychological
    triggers, which may not be adequately captured in our simulated dataset. Moreover,
    While this focus enables detailed insights into these particular domains, it may
    limit the applicability of our findings to other areas where CSE attacks occur,
    such as financial services or customer support.

    and attackers in CSE scenarios. However, there could be issues such as hallucination,
    where the LLM generates responses that are not grounded in reality, and sycophancy,
    where the LLM generates content to please our requests rather than accurately
    representing real-world CSE scenarios. These limitations could potentially affect
    the reliability of our simulated dataset. Nevertheless, as one of the first studies
    to explore this approach, the value of having such a dataset, even with its limitations,
    is that it can serve as a foundation for future work. This initial effort to simulate
    CSE scenarios using LLMs can pave the way for more robust and realistic datasets,
    ultimately improving our understanding and ability to defend against these threats.

    it relies on a retrieval-augmented module that compares incoming messages to a
    historical database of similar conversations. The effectiveness of this module
    is contingent on the quality and comprehensiveness of the historical database,
    which may not always be available or adequately representative of real-world scenarios.

    and addressing the challenges posed by the dual capabilities of LLMs in CSE contexts.
    Future research should aim to expand the scope of our findings, explore advanced
    detection techniques, and consider the broader ethical and practical implications
    of leveraging LLMs for cybersecurity applications.

- en: The simulation of social engineering attacks using LLMs presents potential ethical
    dilemmas. While our dataset, SEConvo is developed to enhance detection and prevention
    methodologies, we acknowledge the potential for misuse of such simulations. Nonetheless,
    we contend that the public availability of the dataset, alongside ConvoSentinel,
    our defense framework, will predominantly empower future research to develop more
    effective and robust defensive mechanisms. Moreover, releasing SEConvo to the
    public is intended to catalyze advancements in cybersecurity by providing researchers
    and practitioners with real-world scenarios to test and refine their defensive
    strategies. This open approach aims to foster a collaborative environment where
    knowledge and resources are shared to improve security measures against SE attacks
    collectively. We are committed to upholding high ethical standards in disseminating
    and using data, advocating for responsible AI use, and continuously improving
    cybersecurity defenses.

    empower researchers and cybersecurity professionals to enhance their comprehension
    and counteract chat-based SE attacks. We emphasize that utilizing our resources
    should be confined to defensive measures within academic, training, and security
    development contexts. We will actively collaborate with the community to monitor
    the deployment and application of these tools, responding swiftly to any indications
    of misuse.

    has shown the use of LLMs to provide free-text and other forms of explanations
    to black-box classifiers to provide some degree of post-hoc interpretability to
    the end user. Given the sensitive nature of this task, we aim to follow prior
    work and provide post-hoc explanations in the form of interpretable features that
    led to the label output by ConvSentinel. To do this, we leverage LLMs to identify
    the features or indicators behind a conversation being labeled as ‘malicious’
    or ‘benign’. We hypothesize that we can effectively use the textual-understanding
    capabilities of LLMs to identify these indicators in text. To do this, we simply
    use GPT-4-Turbo in a zero-shot, off-the-shelf manner and prompt it to identify
    features that lead to the prediction of malicious or benign label for each sample
    in the test set. Table [13](#A3.T13 "Table 13 ‣ Appendix C Explanation and Interpretability
    ‣ Defending Against Social Engineering Attacks in the Age of LLMs") details the
    prompt used for generating the explanations using GPT-4-Turbo. This prompt effectively
    lets GPT-4-Turbo identify human-interpretable features to support the predicted
    malicious or benign label. We add extracted features in Table [14](#A3.T14 "Table
    14 ‣ Appendix C Explanation and Interpretability ‣ Defending Against Social Engineering
    Attacks in the Age of LLMs"). We see that GPT-4-Turbo is able to provide understandable
    and interpretable features that serve as post-hoc explanations for the detection
    pipeline. We do note however, that since the LLM-explanation pipeline is not coupled
    with the detection one, these features are not necessarily faithful, and only
    serve as pointers to the end-user on what could be the features in the input leading
    to the predicted label.
