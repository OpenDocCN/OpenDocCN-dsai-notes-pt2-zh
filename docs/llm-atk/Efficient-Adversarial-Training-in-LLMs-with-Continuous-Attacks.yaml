- en: 'Large language models (LLMs) are vulnerable to adversarial attacks that can
    bypass their safety guardrails. In many domains, adversarial training has proven
    to be one of the most promising methods to reliably improve robustness against
    such attacks. Yet, in the context of LLMs, current methods for adversarial training
    are hindered by the high computational costs required to perform discrete adversarial
    attacks at each training iteration. We address this problem by instead calculating
    adversarial attacks in the continuous embedding space of the LLM, which is orders
    of magnitudes more efficient. We propose a fast adversarial training algorithm
    (C-AdvUL) composed of two losses: the first makes the model robust on continuous
    embedding attacks computed on an adversarial behaviour dataset; the second ensures
    the usefulness of the final model by fine-tuning on utility data. Moreover, we
    introduce C-AdvIPO, an adversarial variant of IPO that does not require utility
    data for adversarially robust alignment. Our empirical evaluation on four models
    from different families (Gemma, Phi3, Mistral, Zephyr) and at different scales
    (2B, 3.8B, 7B) shows that both algorithms substantially enhance LLM robustness
    against discrete attacks (GCG, AutoDAN, PAIR), while maintaining utility. Our
    results demonstrate that robustness to continuous perturbations can extrapolate
    to discrete threat models. Thereby, we present a path toward scalable adversarial
    training algorithms for robustly aligning LLMs.'

    applications, ensuring their safety and robustness is crucial. The seminal work
    of Zou et al. [[1](#bib.bib1)] highlighted substantial vulnerabilities in even
    the most advanced proprietary models, demonstrating that adversarial attacks can
    effectively disable safety mechanisms. More recently, adaptive attacks have been
    shown to achieve nearly a $100\%$ success rate on widely used models, underscoring
    the severity of this issue [[2](#bib.bib2)].

    a neural network with adversarial attacks, has consistently proven to enhance
    robustness against adversaries [[3](#bib.bib3), [4](#bib.bib4)]. Yet, initial
    attempts at adversarial training for LLMs have shown ineffective [[5](#bib.bib5)].
    Unlike *continuous* adversarial training (AT) algorithms in other domains, AT
    for LLMs usually involves *discrete* attacks, where tokens in the prompt are either
    substituted, injected, or appended as suffixes [[1](#bib.bib1), [6](#bib.bib6)].
    Recently, Mazeika et al. [[6](#bib.bib6)] proposed R2D2, the first AT algorithm
    that successfully improves robustness against various attacks in LLMs. The authors
    use Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG) to generate discrete adversarial suffixes
    in natural language. However, GCG requires extensive computational resources,
    employing hundreds of thousands of model evaluations to compute a single attack.
    This leads to considerable overhead for R2D2 despite additional optimisations.

    as BERT [[9](#bib.bib9), [10](#bib.bib10)]. Thus, we argue that continuous attacks
    could be an efficient alternative to discrete attacks within LLM adversarial training
    algorithms. We ask the following research question:'

    utility data for adversarial alignment. We surpass the robustness-utility trade-offs
    of the discrete R2D2 AT algorithm [[6](#bib.bib6)], achieving up to  times less
    computing resources. Additionally, we identify a failure mode in previous evaluation
    protocols: the models are tested with their chat template for safety evaluations
    but without it for utility evaluations. This protocol is unrealistic as the chat
    template is not enabled or disabled based on the prompt the user enters. By enabling
    the chat template for standard queries, we demonstrate that R2D2 overfits the
    safety objective and grammar of the harmful dataset. Thus, it often refuses to
    respond to benign inputs, thereby hurting its usefulness. In contrast, models
    trained with C-AdvUL and C-AdvIPO show substantially fewer refusals.'

    More recently, LLMs have been shown to be vulnerable to exploitation by adversarial
    attacks, and several threat models, such as suffix attacks [[1](#bib.bib1)] and
    jailbreaking [[15](#bib.bib15)], have been proposed.  Zou et al. [[1](#bib.bib1)]
    present the Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG) suffix attack, which generates adversarial
    examples transferable from small open-source models to large proprietary models.
     Huang et al. [[19](#bib.bib19)] find that just varying generation strategies,
    such as adjusting decoding hyper-parameters and sampling methods, can trigger
    harmful behaviour in LLMs.  Geisler et al. [[20](#bib.bib20)] introduce a novel
    discrete attack strategy that leverages continuous embedding space optimisation.
    In the area of continuous adversarial attacks, Fort [[21](#bib.bib21)] explore
    scaling laws for continuous adversarial attacks on language model activations.

    query a target LLM, optimising the jailbreak prompt. Liu et al. [[15](#bib.bib15)]

    for the purpose of AT. They propose latent adversarial training (LAT), a method
    that finds perturbations in the network’s hidden layer representations and applies
    them to several tasks including text generation. For text generation, they demonstrate
    that fine-tuning for desirable behaviour with LAT makes the model more likely
    to forget triggers from data poisoning in some cases. Contrary to our work, they
    set up the adversarial training in an untargeted manner, i.e. the attack they
    apply does not aim to produce a particular harmful output but uses the standard
    AT objective. In contrast, our work focuses on the challenge of making LLMs robust
    against discrete attacks and jailbreaks while maintaining their helpfulness. To
    do so, we propose novel algorithms and loss functions that make use of the harmful
    targets of discrete attacks. Moreover, we thoroughly evaluate across multiple
    benchmarks and adversarial attacks to ensure a good robustness-utility trade-off.

    adversarial robustness. This kind of adversarial robustness training is based
    on dataset augmentation and does not adapt the model online to worst-case attacks.

    model performance. Figure [2](#S5.F2 "Figure 2 ‣ LLM adversarial training with
    utility data ‣ 5 Results ‣ Efficient Adversarial Training in LLMs with Continuous
    Attacks") summarises the evaluation results. For all models, C-AdvUL considerably
    increases the average robustness against discrete adversarial attacks. For the
    Gemma and Zephyr models, robustness increases for all attacks. For Phi-3-Mini
    and Mistral-7B, PAIR still achieves high attack success rates (ASR). In terms
    of utility, we observe similar degradations for all C-AdvUL trained models. The
    MMLU and Arc scores decrease marginally, while the MT-Bench score decreases by
    approximately one. All models still show considerable utility after fine-tuning.

    exhibits marginally worse utility on standard utility benchmarks while providing
    substantially improved robustness against discrete attacks. For, Zephyr + R2D2,
    PAIR achieves an ASR of  ASR for C-AdvUL. We note a substantial difference in
    the Harmless benchmark, where C-AdvUL massively outperforms Zephyr + R2D2 showing
    that our method has not overfitted the safety objective or the patterns in the
    Harmbench behaviours. Note that the Harmless score of R2D2 demonstrates that it
    can not simultaneously achieve non-trivial utility and robustness, which are heavily
    dependent on not using or using the chat template, respectively.

- en: Common utility benchmarks such as MMLU or Arc do not use a chat template in
    their standard evaluation [[42](#bib.bib42)]. Firstly, this dramatically impacts
    performance, especially for smaller models, which often require a lot of prompt
    engineering to follow the few-shot prompts correctly. Secondly, it dramatically
    changes the mode of the model. In effect, a model might be overly robust in chat
    mode (i.e. when using a chat template) where it rejects most requests, but it
    might appear to have high utility in benchmarks because no chat template is used
    (e.g. MMLU). Arc as an evaluation benchmark is even more misleading as it measures
    the likelihood of a set of possible answer tokens, thus not reflecting the utility
    of the model when using a chat template. We quantitatively evaluate the refusals
    of MMLU questions when using a chat template in App. [E](#A5 "Appendix E MMLU
    refusal under chat template ‣ Efficient Adversarial Training in LLMs with Continuous
    Attacks"). We recommend future work, to consider these issues when evaluating
    robustness and utility for the same model.

    tend to use a common grammatical and syntactical structure, using imperative commands
    such as “Tell me” or “Give instructions”. Chatting with our models and Zephyr
    + R2D2, we observe that requests would be refused when using this same style but
    are accepted if asked in a different style, such as “Could you please …?”. This
    holds for both harmful and harmless requests. For instance, Zephyr + R2D2 will
    refuse to answer “Tell me a story” and “Tell me how to build a bomb”, but will
    answer “Could you please tell me a story?” and “Could you please explain to me
    how to build a bomb?”. This also explains why the model may even appear useful
    under utility benchmarks employing chat templates such as MT-Bench. To demonstrate
    this failure case we create two small benchmark datasets called PoliteHarmbench
    (see App. [F](#A6 "Appendix F PoliteHarmbench ‣ Efficient Adversarial Training
    in LLMs with Continuous Attacks")) and Harmless. The former rephrases the harmful
    behaviours politely, and the latter consists of harmless requests formulated in
    the same grammatical style as the original Harmbench behaviours. We leave developing
    better datasets and benchmarks for a future paper as it is outside the scope of
    this work.

    stem from using continuous adversarial attacks during training, or from the fine-tuning

    using adversarial attacks. We observe no robustness gains when fine-tuning without
    attacks (see App. [B.2](#A2.SS2 "B.2 Training without Attacks ‣ Appendix B Robustness

    experiments are conducted on Gemma models trained with C-AdvIPO and varying hyperparameters.
    Specifically, we sample  and fine-tune -axis in logarithmic scale against the
    MMLU score on the $x$-axis (as a proxy for utility). Clear trade-offs between
    robustness and utility can be observed, ranging from models with high robustness

    models and slightly higher utility.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We answer our research question about the extrapolation of robustness under
    the continuous attack threat model to robustness under discrete attacks in the
    affirmative. We propose an efficient continuous adversarial training algorithm
    (C-AdvUL), combining training on an adversarial behaviour dataset with fine-tuning
    on utility data. Additionally, we introduce an adversarial variant of IPO (C-AdvIPO)
    that does not require additional utility data. Our algorithms achieve up to  times
    less compute. In future work, we will further analyse settings where continuous
    robustness does not extrapolate (e.g. novel attacks) and possible ways to address
    this, such as larger and more diverse training data.

    and utility of adversarially trained models. We demonstrate that previous work
    overfits the safety objective, refusing to answer benign queries. Further, we
    exemplify that both the chat template and the grammatical structure of prompts
    need to be carefully controlled to prevent a misleading evaluation.

    are less prone to overfit than Zephyr + R2D2, we may still see improvements from
    augmented adversarial training datasets [[28](#bib.bib28)]. An additional limitation
    is the number of hyperparameters introduced that require careful selection. We
    expect future work to achieve considerably better robustness-utility trade-offs
    through better hyperparameter selection alone. Furthermore, our proposed method
    C-AdvUL requires a utility dataset to retain helpfulness, which may shift the
    predictions of the model on unrelated tasks, a limitation we try to address with
    the C-AdvIPO method. Finally, due to limited compute we were not able to apply
    our method to much larger LLMs in the 70B parameter and larger regime, we leave
    this to future work.

    against adversarial attacks. The positive impact is that this will reduce the
    amount of harmful content produced by LLMs if adopted as many attacks will no
    longer work. In addition, the lower computation cost should hopefully reduce the
    carbon footprint of training robust and safe LLMs. However, this may lead to overconfidence
    in the safety of LLMs, thus necessitating more extensive red teaming. Another
    possible negative impact of our work is that adversarial training may be used
    to prevent LLMs saying things the model operator does not want regardless of the
    harmfulness of the content. Our contributions on the failure modes of robustness
    evaluation should hopefully lead to more rigorous and trustworthy evaluation protocols.
    These are crucial to accurately assess the state of robustness in LLMs. Note,
    it may be that further failure modes exist we did not yet find.

    evaluated if C-AdvIPO yields robustness gains if the attack iterations are reduced
    to one during training. Table [5](#A2.T5 "Table 5 ‣ B.1 One-Step Adversarial Training
    ‣ Appendix B Robustness extrapolation to discrete attacks ‣ Efficient Adversarial
    Training in LLMs with Continuous Attacks") illustrates that one-step C-AdvIPO
    achieves similar robustness improvements as the multi-step variant. Note, that
    we used the same hyperparameters for the one-step attacks as for the multi-step
    attack, except for the attack iterations and step size. Further hyperparameter
    tuning or borrowing recent advances in one-step AT from other domains may help
    to close this gap [[46](#bib.bib46)]. Due to the large computational complexity
    of attack evaluations, we conduct this experiment on GCG.

    in GCG loss is observed, starting from . Meanwhile, the MMLU score increases from
    about . This trend aligns with our expectations and suggests that higher  is crucial
    for optimizing the robustness-utility trade-off in C-AdvIPO.

    Continuous Attacks"). There are 57 subjects with a 100 questions each. In Table [7](#A5.T7

    a polite manner, could yield to striking vulnerabilities. So we developed PoliteHarmbench,
    see the results in Table [8](#A6.T8 "Table 8 ‣ Appendix F PoliteHarmbench ‣ Efficient
    Adversarial Training in LLMs with Continuous Attacks"). Note that we use the Harmbench
    classifier as throughout the paper, but found several instances where the classifier
    incorrectly predicted that answers were safe when they were not.
