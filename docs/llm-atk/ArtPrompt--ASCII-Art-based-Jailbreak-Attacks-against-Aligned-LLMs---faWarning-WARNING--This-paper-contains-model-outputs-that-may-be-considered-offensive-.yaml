- en: Safety is critical to the usage of large language models (LLMs). Multiple techniques
    such as data filtering and supervised fine-tuning have been developed to strengthen
    LLM safety. However, currently known techniques presume that corpora used for
    safety alignment of LLMs are solely interpreted by semantics. This assumption,
    however, does not hold in real-world applications, which leads to severe vulnerabilities
    in LLMs. For example, users of forums often use ASCII art, a form of text-based
    art, to convey image information. In this paper, we propose a novel ASCII art-based
    jailbreak attack and introduce a comprehensive benchmark Vision-in-Text Challenge
    (ViTC) to evaluate the capabilities of LLMs in recognizing prompts that cannot
    be solely interpreted by semantics. We show that five SOTA LLMs (GPT-3.5, GPT-4,
    Gemini, Claude, and Llama2) struggle to recognize prompts provided in the form
    of ASCII art. Based on this observation, we develop the jailbreak attack ArtPrompt,
    which leverages the poor performance of LLMs in recognizing ASCII art to bypass
    safety measures and elicit undesired behaviors from LLMs. ArtPrompt only requires
    black-box access to the victim LLMs, making it a practical attack. We evaluate
    ArtPrompt on five SOTA LLMs, and show that ArtPrompt can effectively and efficiently
    induce undesired behaviors from all five LLMs.

    Llama2 (Touvron et al., [2023](#bib.bib34)), and Gemini (Team et al., [2023](#bib.bib33))
    are increasingly deployed to serve users across various application scenarios.
    Typical examples include math reasoning (Wei et al., [2022b](#bib.bib40)), code
    completion (Zhang et al., [2023a](#bib.bib47)), and creative writing (Yuan et al.,
    [2022](#bib.bib46)). The widespread use of LLMs highlights significant safety
    concerns (Weidinger et al., [2022](#bib.bib43); Wang et al., [2023a](#bib.bib36)).
    Violations of safety can expose users of LLMs to toxic contents (Gehman et al.,
    [2020](#bib.bib17)), bias (Nadeem et al., [2020](#bib.bib27)), and other associated
    risks (Wei et al., [2023a](#bib.bib38)).

    the masked word in Step I with ASCII art. Then the masked prompt is combined with

    First, we develop a benchmark, named *Vision-in-Text Challenge* (ViTC), to evaluate
    the capabilities of five SOTA LLMs (GPT-3.5 (OpenAI, [2023](#bib.bib28)), GPT-4
    (Achiam et al., [2023](#bib.bib1)), Gemini (Team et al., [2023](#bib.bib33)),
    Claude (Anthropic, [2023](#bib.bib3)), and Llama2 (Touvron et al., [2023](#bib.bib34)))
    of perceiving and responding to queries in the form of ASCII art (Wagner, [2023](#bib.bib35)),
    which cannot be interpreted using semantics of characters involved. Our results
    indicate that all five LLMs struggle to understand input queries that use ASCII
    art to represent one single letter or number. Furthermore, the ability of the
    LLMs to correctly recognize input queries drop significantly (close to zero) as
    the input queries contain more letters or numbers.

    vulnerabilities of LLMs to a novel jailbreak attack, termed ArtPrompt. A malicious
    user can launch ArtPrompt by following two steps as depicted in Figure [2](#S1.F2
    "Figure 2 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ ArtPrompt: ASCII Art-based Jailbreak Attacks against
    Aligned LLMs \faWarningWARNING: This paper contains model outputs that may be
    considered offensive."). In Step I, ArtPrompt finds the words within a given prompt
    that may trigger rejections from LLM. In Step II, ArtPrompt crafts a set of cloaked
    prompts by visually encoding the identified words in the first step using ASCII
    art. These cloaked prompts are subsequently sent to the victim LLM to execute
    our jailbreak attack, resulting in responses that fulfill the malicious user’s
    objectives and induce unsafe behaviors from the victim LLM.'

    GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, and Llama2) using two benchmark datasets (AdvBench (Zou
    et al., [2023](#bib.bib49)) and HEx-PHI (Qi et al., [2023](#bib.bib31))). Our
    comparison with five jailbreak attacks (Direct Instruction, GCG (Zou et al., [2023](#bib.bib49)),
    AutoDan (Liu et al., [2023](#bib.bib25)), PAIR (Chao et al., [2023](#bib.bib10)),
    and DeepInception (Li et al., [2023a](#bib.bib23))) demonstrates that ArtPrompt can
    effectively and efficiently induce unsafe behaviors from LLMs, and outperforms
    all attacks on average. We further evaluate ArtPrompt against three defenses (Perplexity,
    Paraphrase (Jain et al., [2023](#bib.bib19)), and Retokenization (Provilkov et al.,
    [2019](#bib.bib30))). We show that ArtPrompt successfully bypasses all defenses.

    Weidinger et al., [2021](#bib.bib42)) have attracted attention. In particular,
    multiple jailbreak attacks against LLMs have been developed. Zou et al. ([2023](#bib.bib49))
    and Jones et al. ([2023](#bib.bib20)) proposed gradient-based methods to search
    for inputs to LLMs that can trigger undesired outputs. Another line of work (Liu
    et al., [2023](#bib.bib25)) used hierarchical genetic algorithm to automatically
    generate jailbreak prompts. Chao et al. ([2023](#bib.bib10)) proposed to use a
    pre-trained LLM to generate adversarial prompt to the victim LLM. Alternatively,
    Mozes et al. ([2023](#bib.bib26)) and Kang et al. ([2023](#bib.bib21)) exploited
    instruction-following behaviors of LLMs to disrupt LLM safety. Manually-crafted
    prompts for jailbreaking LLMs were constructed by Deng et al. ([2023](#bib.bib13))

- en: We categorize current defense against jailbreak attacks into the following two
    categories. The first is Detection-based Defenses, which involve applying input
    or output filters to detect and block potentially harmful user prompts. For example,
    Jain et al. ([2023](#bib.bib19)) adopted input perplexity as an input detection
    mechanism to defend against jailbreak attacks. Helbling et al. ([2023](#bib.bib18))
    leverages LLM’s own capabilities to detect whether it generates harmful outputs.
    SmoothLLM (Robey et al., [2023](#bib.bib32)) detected harmful inputs by randomly
    perturbing multiple copies of inputs and aggregating the corresponding outputs
    to detect adversarial inputs. The second category is Mitigation-based Defenses.
    Jain et al. ([2023](#bib.bib19)) used paraphrase and retokenization to modify
    the input to reduce the success rate of gradient-based jailbreak attacks. Li et al.
    ([2023b](#bib.bib24)) proposed rewindable auto-regressive inference that allows
    LLMs to evaluate their own model outputs, and then use the evaluation result to
    guide the generation towards safer and more reliable outputs. Other defenses leveraged
    in-context prompt demonstration to enhance the safety awareness of LLMs (Wei et al.,
    [2023b](#bib.bib41); Xie et al., [2023](#bib.bib44); Zhang et al., [2023b](#bib.bib48)).

- en: ArtPrompt leverages the following two key insights to exploit the vulnerabilities
    of LLMs and launch jailbreak attacks. First, given that LLMs often struggle with
    the recognition task, substituting words likely to trigger rejection by LLMs with
    ASCII art potentially increases the probability of bypassing safety measures.
    Moreover, when the prompt given to LLMs contains information encoded by ASCII
    art, LLMs may excessively focus on completing the recognition task, potentially
    overlooking safety alignment considerations, leading to unintended behaviors.

    shown in Figure [2](#S1.F2 "Figure 2 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ ArtPrompt: ASCII Art-based
    Jailbreak Attacks against Aligned LLMs \faWarningWARNING: This paper contains
    model outputs that may be considered offensive."). ArtPrompt consists of two steps,
    namely word masking and cloaked prompt generation. In the word masking step, given
    the targeted behavior that the attacker aims to provoke, the attacker first masks
    the sensitive words in the prompt that will likely conflict with the safety alignment
    of LLMs, resulting in prompt rejection. In the cloaked prompt generation step,
    the attacker uses an ASCII art generator to replace the identified words with
    those represented in the form of ASCII art. Finally, the generated ASCII art is
    substituted into the original prompt, which will be sent to the victim LLM to
    generate response. We describe the detailed design of ArtPrompt in the remainder
    of this section.'

    that trigger rejections from LLMs. To serve this purpose, we place a mask on each
    word of the prompt from attacker, resulting in a masked prompt. As illustrated
    in Figure [2](#S1.F2 "Figure 2 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ ArtPrompt: ASCII Art-based Jailbreak
    Attacks against Aligned LLMs \faWarningWARNING: This paper contains model outputs
    that may be considered offensive."), by placing a mask on the word “bomb" from
    the prompt “How to make a bomb?", the attacker generates a masked prompt “How
    to make a  ?". If there are  words in the prompt from attacker, then the attacker
    may generate  such masked prompts in the worst-case. In practice, the number of
    masked prompts will be significantly less than  since the attacker does not need
    to mask function words such as “a”, “the", and “I". These masked prompts will
    later serve as the template when generating the attack prompt in the subsequent
    step.'

- en: Compared to the existing optimization-based jailbreak attacks (Zou et al., [2023](#bib.bib49);
    Jones et al., [2023](#bib.bib20)), masking words that trigger rejections is more
    efficient. The reason is that there are finitely many words within the prompt
    that need to be masked. By contrast, the search space of optimization-based jailbreak
    attacks, however, is discrete and infinite, requiring iterative procedures to
    search for words/tokens that lead to successful jailbreak attacks.

    art generator to substitute the masked word with ASCII art. Subsequently, the
    ASCII art is integrated into the masked prompt obtained from the previous step,
    resulting in a *cloaked prompt*. For example, the ASCII art representing the masked
    word “bomb" is shown in Figure [2](#S1.F2 "Figure 2 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ ArtPrompt:
    ASCII Art-based Jailbreak Attacks against Aligned LLMs \faWarningWARNING: This
    paper contains model outputs that may be considered offensive."). Then this representation
    is combined with the masked prompt to generate the cloaked prompt, as illustrated
    in Figure [2](#S1.F2 "Figure 2 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ ArtPrompt: ASCII Art-based Jailbreak
    Attacks against Aligned LLMs \faWarningWARNING: This paper contains model outputs
    that may be considered offensive."). Finally, the cloaked prompt is sent to the
    victim LLM for jailbreak attacks. An additional example on the cloaked prompt
    and the response from victim model is presented in Appendix [C](#A3 "Appendix
    C ArtPrompt Example ‣ ArtPrompt: ASCII Art-based Jailbreak Attacks against Aligned
    LLMs \faWarningWARNING: This paper contains model outputs that may be considered
    offensive."). We remark that if the attacker generates  masked prompts in Step
    1, then it can create  cloaked prompts for jailbreak attack. Furthermore, all
    the cloaked prompts can be sent to the LLM simultaneously to reduce the latency
    incurred during attack.'

    et al., [2023](#bib.bib13); Yu et al., [2023](#bib.bib45)), ArtPrompt can be automated
    by simply stitching the output of ASCII art generator with the masked prompt.
    Furthermore, the cloaked prompt is readable by humans, making ArtPrompt more stealthy
    and natural compared to jailbreak attacks that manipulate tokens (Zou et al.,

    attacker to launch the jailbreak attack. We observe that ArtPrompt achieves the
    highest ASR among all jailbreak attacks with only one iteration with the victim
    LLM. The reason is ArtPrompt can efficiently construct the set of cloaked prompts,
    and send them to the model in parallel. However, optimization-based jailbreak
    attacks such as GCG require significantly larger amount of iterations to construct
    the prompt. These iterations cannot be processed in parallel because the optimization
    in subsequent iterations depends on results from previous iterations. This highlights
    the efficiency of ArtPrompt compared to existing jailbreak attacks.'

    ArtPrompt when victim LLMs employ defenses PPL, Paraphrase, or Retokenization
    to mitigate jailbreak attacks. We make the following two observations. First,
    ArtPrompt can successfully bypass defenses PPL and Retokenization on all victim
    models. This highlights the urgent need for developing more advanced defenses
    against our ArtPrompt jailbreak attack. We note that Retokenization may even help
    ArtPrompt to improve ASR. We conjecture that this is because the spaces introduced
    by Retokenization forms a new font for ArtPrompt, which further reduces the chance
    of triggering safety measures deployed by victim models. Second, we observe that
    Paraphrase is the most effective defense against ArtPrompt. The reason is that
    Paraphrase may disrupt the arrangement used by ArtPrompt, and thus reduces the
    ASR. However, Paraphrase is still inadequate to mitigate ArtPrompt. We note that
    on average, ArtPrompt achieves 39% ASR and 3.18 HS when Paraphrase is deployed
    by victim models.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this paper, we revealed that semantics-only interpretation of corpora during
    safety alignment creates vulnerabilities to jailbreak attacks. We developed a
    benchmark named Vision-in-Text Challenge (ViTC) to evaluate the capabilities of
    LLMs in recognizing prompts that should not be interpreted purely using semantics.
    Our results showed that five SOTA LLMs struggle with the recognition task specified
    by our benchmark. We demonstrated that such poor performance leads to vulnerabilities.
    We designed a novel jailbreak attacks, named ArtPrompt, to exploit these vulnerabilities.
    We evaluated ArtPrompt on five LLMs against three defenses. Our experimental results
    demonstrated that ArtPrompt can effectively and efficiently provoke unsafe behaviors
    from aligned LLMs.

    multimodal language models is subject to further investigation. We hypothesize
    that ArtPrompt will remain effective to attack multimodal language models. The
    reason is that although multimodal language models can take images as inputs,
    which can be interpreted in a similar manner to ASCII art, cloaked prompts generated
    by ArtPrompt are still in the format of texts. Such input format will confuse
    the model, thereby allowing ArtPrompt to induce unsafe behaviors from multimodal
    language models.
