- en: Jailbreaks on Large language models (LLMs) have recently received increasing
    attention. For a comprehensive assessment of LLM safety, it is essential to consider
    jailbreaks with diverse attributes, such as contextual coherence and sentiment/stylistic
    variations, and hence it is beneficial to study controllable jailbreaking, i.e.
    how to enforce control on LLM attacks. In this paper, we formally formulate the
    controllable attack generation problem, and build a novel connection between this
    problem and controllable text generation, a well-explored topic of natural language
    processing. Based on this connection, we adapt the Energy-based Constrained Decoding
    with Langevin Dynamics (COLD), a state-of-the-art, highly efficient algorithm
    in controllable text generation, and introduce the COLD-Attack framework which
    unifies and automates the search of adversarial LLM attacks under a variety of
    control requirements such as fluency, stealthiness, sentiment, and left-right-coherence.
    The controllability enabled by COLD-Attack leads to diverse new jailbreak scenarios
    which not only cover the standard setting of generating fluent suffix attacks,
    but also allow us to address new controllable attack settings such as revising
    a user query adversarially with minimal paraphrasing, and inserting stealthy attacks
    in context with left-right-coherence. Our extensive experiments on various LLMs
    (Llama-2, Mistral, Vicuna, Guanaco, GPT-3.5) show COLD-Attack’s broad applicability,
    strong controllability, high success rate, and attack transferability. Our code
    is available at [https://github.com/Yu-Fangxu/COLD-Attack](https://github.com/Yu-Fangxu/COLD-Attack).

- en: Recently, jailbreaking on large language models (LLMs) has received increasing
    attention from the machine learning community (Goldstein et al., [2023](#bib.bib21);
    Kang et al., [2023](#bib.bib29)). Identifying various jailbreaks is crucial for
    fixing potential vulnerabilities in LLMs, marking itself an important research
    topic for AI safety. Currently, jailbreaking techniques can be categorized as
    white-box approaches (Guo et al., [2021](#bib.bib23); Wen et al., [2023](#bib.bib72);
    Wallace et al., [2019](#bib.bib68); Zou et al., [2023](#bib.bib84); Zhu et al.,
    [2023](#bib.bib83); Liu et al., [2023c](#bib.bib43)) and black-box methods (Shen
    et al., [2023](#bib.bib63); Wei et al., [2023a](#bib.bib69); Abdelnabi et al.,
    [2023](#bib.bib1); Perez and Ribeiro, [2022](#bib.bib55); Li et al., [2023b](#bib.bib36);
    Zeng et al., [2024](#bib.bib78); Mehrotra et al., [2023](#bib.bib50); Chao et al.,
    [2023](#bib.bib6)). Both strategies are crucial and provide complementary benefits
    in deepening our understanding of LLM robustness. Specifically, white-box methods
    require the use of internal model knowledge but are capable of generating less
    predictable attacks in an automated manner. In comparison, black-box methods can
    directly probe commercial LLMs with no internal access, while they typically rely
    on more patterned prompts. To provide a comprehensive safety evaluation of LLMs,
    both white-box and black-box methods are needed and should be further studied.

- en: 'In this paper, we tackle a critical unresolved challenge in automatic white-box
    methods: the controllability of adversarial LLM attacks. Originally, state-of-the-art
    white-box techniques such as GCG (Zou et al., [2023](#bib.bib84)) fail to produce
    semantically meaningful attacks and are highly susceptible to perplexity-based
    defense. Recent advancements, particularly through two AutoDAN publications (Zhu
    et al., [2023](#bib.bib83); Liu et al., [2023c](#bib.bib43)), have focused on
    generating fluent attacks automatically to bypass perplexity filters for the purpose
    of improving stealthiness. However, fluency alone does not guarantee stealthiness
    in general. More importantly, a thorough safety assessment of LLMs demands rigorous
    adversarial testing across diverse attack features beyond fluency. Currently,
    the path to constraining automatic white-box methods to impose controlled features
    (e.g., sentiments, left-right-coherence, etc) on generated attacks remains an
    open question. To bridge this gap, our work in this paper develops the first automatic
    search framework that gives a unified treatment of controllability and stealthiness
    in white-box LLM attacks.'

    generation problem and connect this problem to controllable text generation, a
    well-explored subfield of natural language processing (NLP). Such a perspective
    bridges two extensively researched domains, offering the potential for automated
    jailbreaking with enhanced stealthiness and controllability. Second, built upon
    this connection, we tailor the Energy-based Constrained Decoding with Langevin
    Dynamics (COLD), a state-of-the-art controllable text generation algorithm developed
    from (Qin et al., [2022](#bib.bib60)), to develop the COLD-Attack framework which
    unifies and automates the search of adversarial LLM attacks under a variety of
    control requirements such as fluency, stealthiness, sentiment, and left-right-coherence.
    Diverging from the discrete token-level optimization in GCG, COLD-Attack leverages
    Langevin dynamics (Welling and Teh, [2011](#bib.bib71)) to perform efficient gradient-based
    sampling in the continuous logit space, and relies on a guided decoding process
    to translate the continuous logit sequences into discrete texts. COLD-Attack can
    be viewed as an energy-based method where one can impose various controls on the
    sampling of LLM attacks via using properly-designed energy functions. For example,
    one can use COLD-Attack to paraphrase a given question into an attack (even under
    sentiment constraints), or insert an attack into two sentences with left-right-coherence
    being maintained. Finally, we demonstrate various advantages of COLD-Attack through
    a comprehensive evaluation study across various old and new settings. Table [1](#S1.T1
    "Table 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ COLD-Attack: Jailbreaking LLMs with Stealthiness and
    Controllability") summarizes a high-level comparison of the existing white-box

    prompts (WitchBOT, [2023](#bib.bib74); DAN, [2023](#bib.bib11)) to create sophisticated
    malicious queries (Wei et al., [2023a](#bib.bib69); Abdelnabi et al., [2023](#bib.bib1);
    Perez and Ribeiro, [2022](#bib.bib55); Liu et al., [2023c](#bib.bib43); Li et al.,
    [2023b](#bib.bib36); Zeng et al., [2024](#bib.bib78)). Interestingly, (Wei et al.,
    [2023a](#bib.bib69)) proposes failure modes such as competing objectives and mismatched
    generalization to guide the design of jailbreak attacks. In addition, (Shah et al.,
    [2023](#bib.bib62); Zeng et al., [2024](#bib.bib78)) unitize LLMs to craft jailbreak
    prompts using persona modulation and persuasion techniques to steer the target
    models to produce harmful responses. Since black-box attacks rely on patterned
    templates, white-box automatic search (Zou et al., [2023](#bib.bib84); Zhu et al.,
    [2023](#bib.bib83); Guo et al., [2021](#bib.bib23); Wen et al., [2023](#bib.bib72);
    Wallace et al., [2019](#bib.bib68); Jones et al., [2023](#bib.bib27)) is needed
    for diversifying attacks. The most well-known automatic search method is GCG (Zou
    et al., [2023](#bib.bib84)), which uses token-level optimization to append an
    adversarial suffix. However, GCG yields gibberish suffixes that are easily detectable
    by simple perplexity-based defense (Jain et al., [2023](#bib.bib25)). To remedy
    this, AutoDAN-Zhu (Zhu et al., [2023](#bib.bib83)) extends GCG via a double-loop
    optimization method to produce fluent jailbreak prompts. However, it utilizes
    an auto-regressive token-by-token generation approach, inherently limiting its
    capability in imposing control on attacks. AutoDAN-Liu (Liu et al., [2023c](#bib.bib43))
    connects white-box and black-box methods via a novel combination of automatic
    genetic search and manually crafted jailbreak prompts. It is unclear how to enforce
    control on attacks generated by AutoDAN-Liu.

    attack generation as the problem of finding a sequence  that simultaneously attacks
    the targeted LLM successfully and satisfies a collection of extra constraints.

    and hence the adversarial cost function used in GCG can be integrated into COLD
    as an extra energy function inducing attack successes. As illustrated in Figure
    [3](#S3.F3 "Figure 3 ‣ 3.3 Connections with Controllable Text Generation ‣ 3 Controllability
    and Stealthiness for Attacks ‣ COLD-Attack: Jailbreaking LLMs with Stealthiness
    and Controllability"), our COLD-Attack framework includes three main steps: (i)
    Energy function formulation: specify energy functions properly to capture the
    attack constraints in ([3.1](#S3.E1 "In 3.1 General Problem: Controllable Attack
    Generation ‣ 3 Controllability and Stealthiness for Attacks ‣ COLD-Attack: Jailbreaking
    LLMs with Stealthiness and Controllability")), (ii) Langevin dynamics sampling:
    run Langevin dynamics recursively for  steps to obtain a good energy-based model
    governing the adversarial attack logits , (iii) Decoding process: leverage an
    LLM-guided decoding process to covert the continuous logit  into discrete text
    attacks . Next we provide more explanations for each step of the algorithm.'

    amount of noise and proper step size, Langevin dynamics ([4.1](#S4.E1 "In 4 COLD-Attack
    ‣ COLD-Attack: Jailbreaking LLMs with Stealthiness and Controllability")) can
    converge to the optimal distribution (Welling and Teh, [2011](#bib.bib71)). Finally,
    after running Langevin dynamics for  steps, we obtain continuous logits sequence  which
    is then decoded into a fluent discrete text attack . The decoding method is subtle
    and borrowed from COLD (Qin et al., [2022](#bib.bib60)). Without the novel decoding
    method from (Qin et al., [2022](#bib.bib60)), the resultant  is typically not
    fluent. The decoding method is reviewed in Appendix [B.2](#A2.SS2 "B.2 LLM-Guided

    the discrete text attack once in the end. This is different than GCG (Zou et al.,
    [2023](#bib.bib84)) which relies on greedy search to perform discrete token-level
    optimization at every step. COLD-Attack also differs from AutoDAN-Zhu (Zhu et al.,
    [2023](#bib.bib83)), which generates fluent attacks in an autoregressive manner.
    The non-autoregressive nature of COLD-Attack enables incorporating complex constraints
    such as left-right-coherence.

    phrases unique to Mistral, which is not studied in GCG work.. In particular, both
    GCG and GCG-reg achieve 100% ASR on Vicuna, Guanaco, and Mistral. This high success
    rate is attributed to an early termination mechanism used in running these methods,
    which stops the optimization process once the outputs of LLMs do not contain any
    predefined rejection phrases (see Table [8](#A3.T8 "Table 8 ‣ C.3 COLD-Attack

    Despite this, COLD-Attack achieves a lower PPL on Llama2\. Since COLD-Attack does

    paraphrase attack setting. To assess the quality of the rephrasing, we adopt standard
    evaluation metrics that measure the lexical and semantic edit between the paraphrased
    and the original queries, including BLEU (Papineni et al., [2002](#bib.bib54)),
    ROUGE (Lin, [2004](#bib.bib38)), and BERTScore (Zhang et al., [2019](#bib.bib79)).
    Since it is unclear how to use AutoDAN in this setting, we utilize GPT-4 to rephrase
    the original malicious instructions as a baseline for comparison and calculate
    the associated evaluation metrics. As shown in Table [3](#S5.T3 "Table 3 ‣ Efficiency.
    ‣ 5.1 Result: Fluent Suffix Attack ‣ 5 Experimental Evaluations ‣ COLD-Attack:
    Jailbreaking LLMs with Stealthiness and Controllability"), our COLD-Attack approach
    not only produces high-quality rephrasing³³3For example, the closer the BERTScore
    is to , the more similar the attack is with respect to the original user query.
    The BERTScore for COLD-Attack is above  on all LLMs, nearly matching the BERTScore
    of 0.75 by GPT-4 rephrase, demonstrating the good quality of rephrasing. but also
    significantly outperforms GPT-4-based rephrased queries in terms of ASR.'

    integrate the lexical constraint energy function, which encourages the inclusion
    of specific words that convey positive (e.g., "joyful") or negative (e.g., "anxious")
    sentiments within the generated prompts. As shown in Table [3](#S5.T3 "Table 3
    ‣ Efficiency. ‣ 5.1 Result: Fluent Suffix Attack ‣ 5 Experimental Evaluations

    effectively controls the sentiment of the adversarial prompts, as demonstrated
    by the high Succ and ASRs (here ASRs are only computed for samples categorized
    as target sentiments). Interestingly, our experiments reveal that different LLMs
    exhibit varying susceptibilities to different sentiments. Particularly, attacks
    leveraging negative sentiment attain higher ASRs on Mistral and Guanaco, with
    ASR-G augmenting by 30% and 14% respectively. Conversely, Llama2 shows greater
    vulnerability to positive sentiment attacks, where its ASR-G saw an 18% increase
    when shifting from negative to positive sentiment attacks. This shows that emotional
    stimuli influence on LLM safety is model-dependent, and the controllability of
    attacks is essential for holistically evaluating LLM safety.'

    craft bridge prompts that seamlessly connect the original malicious queries and
    a separate prompt constraining the outputs of LLMs. We set up separate prompts
    to manipulate the outputs of LLMs to adhere to four distinct types of constraints:
    1\. Sentimental constraint aims to manipulate the sentiment of the LLMs’ responses.
    2\. Lexical constraint ensures the inclusion of specified words within the output
    of LLMs. 3\. Format constraint dictates the structure of the LLMs’ response, requiring
    outputs in particular formats such as JSON or Markdown. 4\. Style constraint directs
    the responses of LLMs to mimic the style of specific platforms, such as Twitter
    or Instagram. See Table [6](#A3.T6 "Table 6 ‣ C.3 COLD-Attack Experimental Setup
    ‣ Appendix C Experimental Details ‣ COLD-Attack: Jailbreaking LLMs with Stealthiness
    and Controllability") for the detailed prompts utilized for each constraint type.
    We use PPL to measure the fluency of the generated adversarial prompts. For the
    sentimental control, generated outputs are also evaluated using an external discriminator
    (Loureiro et al., [2022](#bib.bib46)). The success rates under format and style
    constraints are determined through human annotations. For baseline comparisons,
    we concatenate the malicious queries with the control prompt before submitting
    them to the target LLM, Llama2 to be specific (denoted as prompt-only). In addition,
    we utilize the suffixes generated by AutoDAN-Zhu and GCG as bridging sentences

    stealthy attacks that satisfy the left-right-coherence requirement but also allows
    the use of separate prompts to pose output constraints on the target LLMs. Specifically,
    both the ASR and ASR-G exceed 80%, with the highest PPL equal to 99.03 for Guanaco
    under lexical constraint. Moreover, the success rates (Succ) remain above 68%
    for all types of constraints and across all tested LLMs. Compared to baseline
    approaches, both COLD-Attack and AutoDAN attain higher ASRs and significantly
    lower PPL values than GCG. Notably, COLD-Attack consistently records the lowest
    PPL across all constraint scenarios, averaging 2 lower than AutoDAN-Zhu and approximately
    40 less than GCG. This demonstrates the importance of posing control on the left-right-coherence

    and controllable adversarial prompts. Our study establishes the strong capability
    of COLD-Attack to embed a variety of controlled features within attacks. Comprehensive
    evaluations across three distinct attack settings indicate the versatility and
    effectiveness of COLD-Attack. It is our hope that our unified perspective on connecting
    LLM jailbreaking and controllable text generation will inspire more research on
    diversifying the features of adversarial attacks.

    adversarial prompts targeting LLMs. With the escalating interest in jailbreaking
    LLMs within both academia and industry, the direct harm of COLD-Attack remains
    incremental and limited. We believe our research significantly contributes to
    deepening the understanding of LLM robustness and enhancing their safety, thereby
    fostering safer AI environments across various applications.

- en: Safety-aligned LLMs are trained to match human values to ensure that their behavior
    aligns with desired ethical standards [Korbak et al., [2023](#bib.bib30)]. Various
    methods have been developed to enhance this alignment. For instance, data filtering
    is employed to remove harmful, confidential, or prejudiced content from the training
    dataset to prevent the propagation of such content in the LLM’s outputs [Brown
    et al., [2020](#bib.bib4), Touvron et al., [2023](#bib.bib66)]. Supervised safety
    fine-tuning [Chung et al., [2022](#bib.bib10), Touvron et al., [2023](#bib.bib66)]
    teaches LLMs to align with safety-oriented guidelines to further ensure their
    responses adhere to predefined safety protocols. Furthermore, Reinforcement Learning
    from Human Feedback (RLHF) fine-tunes LLMs using a reward model trained on human
    preferences, which adjusts pre-trained models to better reflect human values,
    steering clear of generating harmful content by leveraging rewards that emphasize
    helpfulness and harmlessness [Christiano et al., [2017](#bib.bib9), Ouyang et al.,
    [2022](#bib.bib53), Bai et al., [2022](#bib.bib3), Leike et al., [2018](#bib.bib33),
    Glaese et al., [2022](#bib.bib20)]. RLHF, in particular, plays a pivotal role
    in refining the output of LLMs, ensuring their utility while mitigating risks
    associated with generating undesirable content.

    Jailbreaking LLMs with Stealthiness and Controllability"), a variety of techniques
    have been developed to jailbreak Large Language Models (LLMs) from different perspectives:
    AutoPrompt [Shin et al., [2020](#bib.bib64)] uses a two-step optimization method
    to automatically create LLM prompts for a diverse set of tasks. Persona modulation
    [Shah et al., [2023](#bib.bib62)] facilitates personality for LLMs to make them
    more likely to comply with harmful instructions. [Zhao et al., [2024](#bib.bib81)]
    explores the manipulation of LLM output logits to increase the likelihood of generating
    harmful content. GBRT [Wichers et al., [2024](#bib.bib73)] utilizes the gradient
    information for automatically generating diverse prompts that are likely to cause
    an language model to output unsafe responses, where the prompts are updated by
    scoring an LM response with a safety classifier and then backpropagating through
    the frozen safety classifier and language model. Furthermore, [Yang et al., [2023](#bib.bib76)]
    employ fine-tuning LLMs with a small amount of malicious content to subtly undermine
    LLM safety mechanisms. [Rando and Tramèr, [2023](#bib.bib61)] contaminate the
    RLHF training dataset to undermine the safety of LLMs. In addition, other forms
    of jailbreak such as multimodal jailbreak [Gong et al., [2023](#bib.bib22), Tu
    et al., [2023](#bib.bib67), Qi et al., [2023](#bib.bib57), Carlini et al., [2023](#bib.bib5)],
    in-context attacks [Wei et al., [2023b](#bib.bib70), Kandpal et al., [2023](#bib.bib28),
    Qiang et al., [2023](#bib.bib58)]. [shu et al., [2024](#bib.bib65), Yip et al.,
    [2024](#bib.bib77)] investigate the susceptibility of LLMs to various attack vectors.
    MJP [Li et al., [2023a](#bib.bib34)] crafts multi-step prompts to extract privacy
    information from ChatGPT.  [Liu et al., [2023e](#bib.bib45), Zhang and Ippolito,
    [2023](#bib.bib80)] employ jailbreak attacks to extract system prompts of LLMs,
    RADIAL [Du et al., [2023](#bib.bib17)] examines the rejection tendencies of LLMs,
    aiming to amplify their potential for generating harmful responses. Additionally,
    [Perez and Ribeiro, [2022](#bib.bib55), Deng et al., [2022](#bib.bib14), Anonymous,
    [2024](#bib.bib2)] use reinforcement learning (RL) techniques to discover prompts
    that lead models to generate harmful responses. [Lapid et al., [2023](#bib.bib32)]
    generates attacks built upon genetic algorithm. MASTERKEY [Deng et al., [2023](#bib.bib13)]
    automatically generates jailbreak prompts for fine-tuning LLMs. These diverse
    methods highlight the evolving landscape of LLM vulnerabilities and underscore
    the need for more reliable alignment and safety mechanisms.'

    generation within NLP. Existing approaches focus on enforcing lexical constraints
    by altering the decoding strategy, effectively changing the search space for text
    generation. For instance, Post [Post and Vilar, [2018](#bib.bib56)] integrates
    constraints directly into the beam search process. GeDi [Krause et al., [2020](#bib.bib31)]
    and DExperts [Liu et al., [2021a](#bib.bib39)] employ contrastive methods to adjust
    token distribution autoregressive. On the other hand, PPO-MCTS [Liu et al., [2023b](#bib.bib42)]
    leverages Monte-Carlo Tree Search for decoding guidance. Recent studies focus
    on utilizing language models for controllable text-generation tasks. For instance,
    InstructCTG [Zhou et al., [2023](#bib.bib82)] and COGNACGEN [Chen et al., [2022](#bib.bib7)]
    utilize natural language instructions for desired text generation. Diffusion-LM
    [Li et al., [2022](#bib.bib35)] and LatentOps [Liu et al., [2023a](#bib.bib41)]
    integrate control mechanisms during the diffusion process from embedding and latent
