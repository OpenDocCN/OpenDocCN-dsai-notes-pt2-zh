- en: Penetration testing, an essential component of cybersecurity, allows organizations
    to proactively identify and remediate vulnerabilities in their systems, thus bolstering
    their defense mechanisms against potential cyberattacks. One recent advancement
    in the realm of penetration testing is the utilization of Language Models (LLMs).
    We explore the intersection of LLMs and penetration testing to gain insight into
    their capabilities and challenges in the context of privilige escalation. We create
    an automated Linux privilege-escalation benchmark utilizing local virtual machines.
    We introduce an LLM-guided privilege-escalation tool designed for evaluating different
    LLMs and prompt strategies against our benchmark.

    learning, and the advantages of offering high-level guidance to LLMs. We discuss
    challenging areas for LLMs, including maintaining focus during testing, coping

    with human hackers.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the rapidly evolving field of cybersecurity, penetration testing (“pen-testing”)
    plays a pivotal role in identifying and mitigating potential vulnerabilities in
    a system. A crucial subtask of pen-testing is Linux privilege escalation, which
    involves exploiting a bug, design flaw, or configuration oversight in an operating
    system or software application to gain elevated access to resources that are normally
    protected from an application or user [[40](#bib.bib40)]. The ability to escalate
    privileges can provide a malicious actor with increased access, potentially leading
    to more significant breaches or system damage. Therefore, understanding and improving
    the performance of tools used for this task is highly relevant. In this paper,
    we focus on investigating the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the
    context of penetration testing, specifically for Linux privilege escalation. LLMs
    have shown remarkable abilities in emulating human behavior that can be leveraged
    to automate and enhance various tasks in pen-testing [[7](#bib.bib7), [17](#bib.bib17)].
    However, there is currently no understanding on how these models perform in common
    privilege escalation scenarios.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To address this gap, we developed a comprehensive benchmark for Linux privilege
    escalation. This benchmark provides a standardized platform to evaluate and compare
    the performance of different LLMs in a controlled manner. We perform an empirical
    analysis of various LLMs using this benchmark, providing insight into their strengths
    and weaknesses in the context of privilege escalation. Our findings will contribute
    to ongoing efforts to improve the capabilities of LLMs in cybersecurity, particularly
    in penetration testing. By understanding the performance of these models in the
    critical task of privilege escalation, we can guide future research and development
    efforts to improve their effectiveness and reliability.

    trained knowledge inherently stored within the model with external knowledge.

    example, the amount of tokens generated by OpenAI’s tokenizer (used by GPT-3.5-turbo
    and GPT-4) was smaller than the amount produced by the llama one. The tested GPT-models

    prompt plus generated answer.

    using up the additional context size as only a single run exceeds the original
    context size of 4k. When looking at the executed commands, GPT-3.5-turbo is filling
    up the context size with output of “broad” commands such as “ps aux” or rather
    senseless “find / -type f” commands while GPT-4 executes rather targeted commands
    that only slowly fill up the context. We speculate that the smaller GPT-3.5-turbo

    use the cron job to prepare suid binaries, create additional sudo permissions

    an ongoing bug this led to instabilities when using context sizes larger than
    2k. Bear in mind that the tokenizer used by Llama is less efficient than the tokenizers
    used by GPT and that they count both input and output tokens for their limits.
  prefs: []

    generated qualitative substantive results. To allow for the less-efficient tokenizer,
