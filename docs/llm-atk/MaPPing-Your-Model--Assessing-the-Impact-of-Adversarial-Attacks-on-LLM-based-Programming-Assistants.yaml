- en: LLM-based programming assistants offer the promise of programming faster but
    with the risk of introducing more security vulnerabilities. Prior work has studied
    how LLMs could be maliciously fine-tuned to suggest vulnerabilities more often.
    With the rise of agentic LLMs, which may use results from an untrusted third party,
    there is a growing risk of attacks on the model’s prompt. We introduce the Malicious
    Programming Prompt (MaPP) attack, in which an attacker adds a small amount of
    text to a prompt for a programming task (under 500 bytes). We show that our prompt
    strategy can cause an LLM to add vulnerabilities while continuing to write otherwise
    correct code. We evaluate three prompts on seven common LLMs, from basic to state-of-the-art
    commercial models. Using the HumanEval benchmark, we find that our prompts are
    broadly effective, with no customization required for different LLMs. Furthermore,
    the LLMs that are best at HumanEval are also best at following our malicious instructions,
    suggesting that simply scaling language models will not prevent MaPP attacks.
    Using a dataset of eight CWEs in 16 scenarios, we find that MaPP attacks are also
    effective at implementing specific and targeted vulnerabilities across a range
    of models. Our work highlights the need to secure LLM prompts against manipulation
    as well as rigorously auditing code generated with the help of LLMs.

    programmers in writing code. For example, GitHub Copilot had over 1.3 million
    paid subscribers in early 2024 (Mic, [2024](#bib.bib1)). However, code written
    with LLMs may also introduce security vulnerabilities, and programmers may be
    less likely to notice such vulnerabilities due to “automation bias” (Goddard et al.,
    [2012](#bib.bib9); SKITKA et al., [1999](#bib.bib25)), in which people trust automated
    suggestions over their own knowledge and intuition. This makes code LLMs a prime
    target for adversaries who want to create security vulnerabilities but lack direct
    access to the code.

    LLMs can now perform web searches and use the retrieved documents as part of the
    prompt. Some LLMs, such as ChatGPT, have broader agentic capabilities through
    plugins or the ability to write and execute code. This is often done with limited
    human involvement, and the exact operations and information used may not always
    be easy to inspect. The result is that *it is easier than ever for an attacker
    to influence an LLM’s prompt*, so that the attacker controls some of the instructions

    an attacker inserts instructions into the prompt of a coding LLM and uses it to
    induce code vulnerabilities. This corresponds to a threat model where the user
    prompts an LLM to generate code, but one portion of the prompt is contributed
    by an attacker who instructs the LLM to include insecure code in the generation

    range of code contexts compared to narrower vulnerabilities (e.g., CWEs). This

    succeed in introducing our three different vulnerabilities into generated code,
    and can do so without a large decrease in the correctness of the prompted code.

    language generation (Chen et al., [2021](#bib.bib7)). In some cases, language
    models can even be specialized for certain programming languages like Python (Rozière
    et al., [2024](#bib.bib21)). One of the standard evaluations for a model’s coding
    ability is the HumanEval benchmark (Chen et al., [2021](#bib.bib7)). This is a
    dataset of 164 Python function headers and docstrings, along with unit tests for
    checking for the correct output. This benchmark evaluates whether a model can
    generate code that is both valid and fulfills the given task. Prior work (Mozannar
    et al., [2024](#bib.bib15)) also finds that LLMs, especially instruct-tuned models,
    have a positive impact on programmers’ productivity in completing code tasks.

    external tools and processes that dynamically load content into the context window.
    Some previous approaches to using LLMs for code generation involve retrieval augmented
    generation (RAG) (Lewis et al., [2021](#bib.bib14); Jimenez et al., [2024](#bib.bib11)),
    in which relevant pieces of text from a database are loaded into the context of
    an LLM. There is also burgeoning interest in creating agents using LLMs that are
    more effective at coding than just using the LLM directly (Tufano et al., [2024](#bib.bib26);
    Yang et al., [2024](#bib.bib31)). These agents write and execute code with minimal
    human intervention, and often access external data through tools like web browsing.

    Similar systematic testing through CyberSecEval (Bhatt et al., [2023](#bib.bib5))
    shows that even highly capable models will generate security vulnerabilities across
    a range of languages. Other previous work tested the prevalence of security vulnerabilities
    when users are assisted by LLM code generation systems. Some user studies show
    that LLM coding assistants have minimal impact on security (Sandoval et al., [2023](#bib.bib22)),

    interests of the users and developers. Prior work considers how an attacker could
    intentionally influence the output of an LLM. These attacks vary based on their
    assumptions about the adversary’s knowledge and capabilities. Given the ability
    to train or fine-tune the weights of an LLM, adversaries can use multiple different
    methods to compromise their security. For example, Schuster et al. ([2020](#bib.bib23))
    show that LLMs are more likely to generate insecure code if maliciously-crafted
    “poison” examples are added to their training data. In other attacks, the LLM
    only generates malicious code when a particular trigger phrase is present (Aghakhani
    et al., [2024](#bib.bib2); Kurita et al., [2020](#bib.bib13); Wan et al., [2023](#bib.bib28)).
    Given knowledge of weights or generation details such as logits, adversaries can
    also perform specialized attacks that optimize some aspects of the input to direct
    the output in specific and unintended directions (Ebrahimi et al., [2018](#bib.bib8);
    Wu et al., [2023](#bib.bib30)).

- en: '*Prompt injections* are a specific type of attack on LLMs intended to modify
    the behavior by adding malicious text to the LLM’s context. In *direct prompt
    injections*, the user attempts to override the system prompt or safety finetuning
    with conflicting instructions (Wei et al., [2023](#bib.bib29)). These models have
    been heavily integrated into existing applications and external toolsets, much
    of it lying outside a user’s direct view. These external tools can lead to *indirect
    prompt injections*, where an attacker places additional instructions or information
    in the context of an unaware user’s LLM (Greshake et al., [2023](#bib.bib10)).
    These instructions can drastically change the behavior of the model, but they
    also have the ability to subtly change behaviors in targeted ways. When these
    attacks are aimed at code generation tasks, they can introduce security vulnerabilities (Yang
    et al., [2023](#bib.bib32)). With carefully crafted attacks or a lack of attention
    from the end user, these malicious vulnerabilities can be deployed in production
    environments.'

    a malicious *attacker* or adversary. The user’s goal is to write correct and secure
    code using an agentic LLM, but they may not check the LLM-generated code very
    carefully. The attacker’s goal is to induce vulnerabilities in the user’s code
    via the LLM. The attacker can *insert a short string (under 500 characters) into
    the prompt* through some means. Depending on the specific setting and the attacker’s
    level of access, this could be done by directly editing the system prompt, manipulating
    a process used by the agentic LLM, or performing an indirect prompt attack through
    RAG. In the general purpose attack, the attacker succeeds if their prompt insertion
    causes the LLM to *generate code with security vulnerabilities that also passes
    basic code correctnesss tests*. The latter condition increases the chances of
    the user accepting and using the vulnerable code as-is. In the narrow attack,
    the attacker succeeds if their prompt insertion causes the LLM to *generate code
    with the scenario’s security vulnerability as rated by GitHub CodeQL or human
    analysis*.

    libraries won’t have vulnerabilities in networking code. The contexts in which
    suggestions are generated is also relevant: a prompt may consist of a comment
    with instructions about the code to be written, or just the existing code already
    present in an incomplete function, and thus the suggestions could range from completing
    the current line of code with a single function call to generating a whole set
    of classes and methods. Programmers vary in experience and caution, so an error
    that is accepted by one programmer might be rejected by another. If the error

    Effectiveness Rate ‣ 4.2 CWE attacks ‣ 4 Evaluation ‣ MaPPing Your Model: Assessing
    the Impact of Adversarial Attacks on LLM-based Programming Assistants")). In the
    control case with no MaPP attack, the LLMs made only a few vulnerable files, usually
    in cases where a user might also have made the same choices. However, with the
    MaPP attack prompts, the LLMs made a multitude of vulnerabilities they otherwise
    wouldn’t, such as using unsafe functions in networking application such as yaml.load(),
    which allows for the execution of arbitrary python code. There are some incorrect
    generations for some scenarios where the model failed to listen to the original
    scenario instructions, but these were counted as not vulnerable for the purposes
    of this test. Despite this, vulnerabilities were generated at least 75% of the
    time in all models during the adversarial test, with GPT-4o generating vulnerabilities
    100% of the time in the adversarial test.'

- en: LLMs are often fine-tuned to avoid bad behavior such as creating vulnerabilities.
    However, none of the models have any problem following our instructions to generate
    malicious code. Part of this is the fact that the instructions themselves are
    completely reasonable instructions in some contexts; setting a random seed or
    repeatedly modifying a list are normal operations. The problem is in introducing
    them in the wrong context and without user awareness or consent. No “jailbreak”
    is required to obtain this behavior. This suggests that current approaches to
    LLM safety, including RLHF (Ouyang et al., [2022](#bib.bib17)), are inadequate
    to prevent such attacks.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Instruction hierarchy (Wallace et al., [2024](#bib.bib27)) and other techniques
    that limit a model’s ability to follow instructions from uncontrolled sources
    are a good step towards resolving the problem, since they would reduce indirect
    prompt injections. However, this reduction may not be enough to *guarantee* safety.
    Users and developers must establish stringent safety checks on both model inputs
    and model outputs. Attackers need to be restricted from manipulating the prompt
    directly and indirectly. For example, system prompts for deployed models should
    both be difficult to modify for an adversary and easy for a user to audit for
    unwanted changes, and tool and RAG usage should be limited as much as possible
    to trusted APIs and data sources. Developers should also establish effective code
    vetting strategies on outputted code from models through the use of static code
    evaluators such as GitHub CodeQL and manual code review processes.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As LLMs become increasingly equipped with tools, integrated into developer applications,
    and placed within agentic frameworks, there are security concerns that need to
    be addressed. Empirically, an attacker who inserts text into the prompt can induce
    vulnerabilities with a high success rate and minimal impact on the functional
    correctness of the code. In spite of attempts to make LLMs safe, the risk is highest
    with the largest, most capable models.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Much work remains to be done on making LLM-based programming systems more secure.
    Since our attacks rely on prompt modifications that the user never sees, the best
    defense is to make LLM systems more transparent.

- en: In this paper, we discuss vulnerabilities and implementation techniques for
    malicious attacks. There is an inherent risk of informing or encouraging potential
    attackers to perform these attacks. However, our tested vulnerabilities are quite
    simple in design and can be easily detected from a code review. Consequently,
    we believe the marginal risk posed by our paper to be minimal. By shedding light
    on the possibility of MaPP attacks, we hope to advance safety research and encourage
    safer practices and proactive measures before these and other attacks become prevalent
    in the wild.
