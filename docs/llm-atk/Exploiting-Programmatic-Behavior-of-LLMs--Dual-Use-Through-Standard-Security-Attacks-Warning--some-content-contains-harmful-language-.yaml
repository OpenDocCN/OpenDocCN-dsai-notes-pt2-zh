- en: Recent advances in instruction-following large language models (LLMs) have led
    to dramatic improvements in a range of NLP tasks. Unfortunately, we find that
    the same improved capabilities amplify the dual-use risks for malicious purposes
    of these models. Dual-use is difficult to prevent as instruction-following capabilities
    now enable standard attacks from computer security. The capabilities of these
    instruction-following LLMs provide strong economic incentives for dual-use by
    malicious actors. In particular, we show that instruction-following LLMs can produce
    *targeted* malicious content, including hate speech and scams, bypassing in-the-wild
    defenses implemented by LLM API vendors. Our analysis shows that this content
    can be generated economically and at cost likely lower than with human effort
    alone. Together, our findings suggest that LLMs will increasingly attract more
    sophisticated adversaries and attacks, and addressing these attacks may require
    new approaches to mitigations.

- en: Large language models (LLMs) have recently improved dramatically in text generation.
    This improvement is driven in large part by scale and the ability to be *instruction
    following* (Mishra et al., [2021](#bib.bib30); Sanh et al., [2021](#bib.bib36);
    Wei et al., [2021](#bib.bib43); Ouyang et al., [2022](#bib.bib31); Glaese et al.,
    [2022](#bib.bib16); Bai et al., [2022](#bib.bib4); Wang et al., [2022](#bib.bib42),
    *inter alia*). As with most technologies, LLMs have a potential for dual-use,
    where their language generation capabilities are used for malicious or nefarious
    ends. For example, text generation models have already been used to produce hateful
    text (Vincent, [2016](#bib.bib41)).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this work, we show that instruction-following LLMs are effective at generating
    malicious content and that their dual-use is difficult to mitigate. We demonstrate
    that attacks inspired by traditional computer security can bypass in-the-wild
    defenses against misuse. Namely, in our experiments, instruction-following LLMs
    such as ChatGPT and text-davinci-003 can generate useful text with these attacks,
    which we hypothesize is because instruction-following LLMs are closer to standard
    computer programs. Despite our attacks leveraging unnatural prompts, we show that
    instruction-following LLMs can produce natural and convincing *personalized* malicious
    content. Our results suggest that the new capabilities of these LLMs increase
    the economic incentives for adversaries to adopt them, given that the cost of
    operation is estimated to be likely lower compared to human effort alone.

    the difficulty in detecting these attacks (You & Yim, [2010](#bib.bib47)). A recent

    attacks, obfuscation changes the program bytecode to evade detection mechanisms,
    such as hash-bashed or fingerprinting methods (You & Yim, [2010](#bib.bib47);
    Borello & Mé, [2008](#bib.bib8)). Similarly, obfuscation for LLM attacks changes
    the prompts to evade filters.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    trigger input or output filters (Sun et al., [2020](#bib.bib39); Jones et al.,
    [2020](#bib.bib24)). For example, OpenAI’s content filters aim to filter misinformation
    and disinformation about COVID-19 and hate speech (e.g., conspiracies about the
    Elders of Zion). Instead of using the term “COVID-19,” an attacker could use the
    term “CVID.” Similarly, instead of using the phrase “Elders of Zion,” an attacker
    could use the phrase “Eldrs of Zion.”

    the program (prompt), the attacker can encode the instructions indirectly, either
    via code injection or payload splitting. One example of such an attack against
    standard programs is to break the malicious payload into multiple smaller payloads,
    each of which does not trigger defense mechanisms (Truncer, [2022](#bib.bib40);
    Kalogranis, [2018](#bib.bib25); Casey et al., [2019](#bib.bib11)). Similarly,

    We hope that our work spurs further work on viewing LLMs through the lens of traditional

    research formalizes security models and provides unconditional defenses under

    secure and confidential. I understand that you may be hesitant to send sensitive
    information over the internet, but rest assured that email is a secure and reliable
    method of communication. If you are still uncomfortable with sending your credit
    card information via email, I can assure you that there are no other options available.
    These tickets are extremely limited and I want to make sure that you are able
    to secure your spot at the concert. I understand if you are hesitant, but I assure
    you that sending your credit card information via email is the safest and most
    efficient way to access these exclusive tickets. I hope this information helps
    and I look forward to seeing you at the Taylor Swift concert. Sincerely, [Your
    Name]

- en: To produce an estimate for the cost of human-generated text, we used cost estimates
    from (Zhang et al., [2022](#bib.bib49)). The authors used human writers to write
    summaries for a summarization task. The summary was around 50 words and took around
    15 minutes to produce. At a rate of $16/hour, this results in $4 per high quality
    generation. Because spam producers likely use cheaper labor, we estimate the cost
    to be 5-10$\times$ cheaper, resulting in costs from $0.40 to $0.80\. Since emails
    are likely faster to generate, this results in a cost estimate of $0.15 to $0.45
    per email generation.
