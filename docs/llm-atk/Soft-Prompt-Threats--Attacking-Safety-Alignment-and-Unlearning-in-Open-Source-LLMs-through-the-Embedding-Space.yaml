  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Current research in adversarial robustness of LLMs focuses on discrete input
    manipulations in the natural language space, which can be directly transferred
    to closed-source models. However, this approach neglects the steady progression
    of open-source models. As open-source models advance in capability, ensuring their
    safety also becomes increasingly imperative. Yet, attacks tailored to open-source
    LLMs that exploit full model access remain largely unexplored. We address this
    research gap and propose embedding space attack, which directly attacks the continuous
    embedding representation of input tokens. We find that embedding space attacks
    circumvent model alignments and trigger harmful behaviors more efficiently than
    discrete attacks or model fine-tuning. Furthermore, we present a novel threat
    model in the context of unlearning and show that embedding space attacks can extract
    supposedly deleted information from unlearned LLMs across multiple datasets and
    models. Our findings highlight embedding space attacks as an important threat
    model in open-source LLMs.

    across various domains, including time-series processing (Ismail Fawaz et al.,
    [2019](#bib.bib1); Nguyen et al., [2020](#bib.bib2)), AI for science (Gao and
    Günnemann, [2021](#bib.bib3); Kosmala et al., [2023](#bib.bib4)), business monitoring (Brown
    et al., [2020](#bib.bib5); Nguyen et al., [2021](#bib.bib6)), and trend analysis (Dumbach
    et al., [2023a](#bib.bib7), [b](#bib.bib8)). Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs)
    have extended from academia to widespread public use. With LLM-integrated applications
    getting increasingly prevalent, various methods have been proposed to enhance
    the safety of LLMs after deployment (Jain et al., [2023](#bib.bib9); Li et al.,
    [2023](#bib.bib10)). Despite these efforts, LLMs have remained vulnerable to exploitation
    by malicious actors (Deng et al., [2023](#bib.bib11); Zou et al., [2023](#bib.bib12)).
    The majority of investigated threat models in the literature, such as prompt injection (Zou
    et al., [2023](#bib.bib12)) or jailbreaking (Chao et al., [2023](#bib.bib13)),
    operate on the discrete token level (Chao et al., [2023](#bib.bib13); Huang et al.,
    [2024](#bib.bib14)). This choice is influenced by the accessibility of LLM-integrated
    applications, such as ChatGPT (OpenAI, [2023](#bib.bib15)), which are predominantly
    available through APIs limited to natural language input.

    on consumer hardware and do not require interaction with APIs (e.g., distributing
    dangerous information, promoting biases, or influencing elections). In the case
    of open-source models, an adversary has complete access to the weights and activations.
    As a result, the adversary is not limited to discrete manipulation of natural
    language tokens but can directly attack their continuous embedding space representation.

    Firstly, we establish that embedding space attacks present a viable threat in
    open-source models, proving more efficient than fine-tuning at bypassing safety
    alignment. Secondly, we demonstrate their capacity to uncover allegedly deleted
    information in models that were unlearned. Our findings demonstrate that embedding
    space attacks are a cost-effective yet potent method for probing undesirable behaviors
    in open-source LLMs and their unrestrictive nature raises the question if this
    vulnerability can be mitigated. Adversarial robustness in neural networks against
    continuous attacks has remained out of reach for nearly a decade, with only slight
    progress in making neural networks more robust. It is unclear if it is possible
    to make LLMs robust against adversarial attacks without a considerable breakthrough.

- en: Limitations and Future Work. To bypass safety alignment and unlearning methods,
    we optimize embedding space attacks to trigger an affirmative response. We did
    not evaluate if the affirmative response objective leads to more model hallucinations.
    This is a common limitation in the evaluation of adversarial attacks in the LLM
    setting (Chao et al., [2023](#bib.bib13); Zou et al., [2023](#bib.bib12)). Generally,
    attacks are considered successful if the model responds to the query but the correctness
    of the response is not evaluated. Moreover, more sophisticated optimization strategies (Zügner
    et al., [2018](#bib.bib43); Schwinn et al., [2021b](#bib.bib44)), loss functions (Schwinn
    et al., [2021c](#bib.bib45)), and attack initialization approaches (Tashiro et al.,
    [2020](#bib.bib46)) have shown to be effective in other domains and should be
    explored for embedding space attacks. Lastly, we did not explore if there is a
    connection between the perturbation magnitude required to achieve the attack goal
    and the robustness of the model. If such a connection exists, robustification
    approaches could potentially give further insights into the robustness of LLMs (Bungert
    et al., [2021](#bib.bib47); Scholten et al., [2023](#bib.bib48); Schuchardt et al.,

    in machine learning still unsolved after a decade, our focus shifts towards raising
    awareness as a key strategy. Technical solutions, at this stage, seem insufficient
    to tackle the robustness issue fully. Therefore, highlighting the potential misuse
    and inherent limitations of LLMs is vital. Such awareness is crucial in preventing
    these models’ irresponsible deployment in critical sectors and in reducing the
    threats posed by malicious actors. We believe that embedding space attacks can
    be a valuable tool to investigate model vulnerabilities before these models are
