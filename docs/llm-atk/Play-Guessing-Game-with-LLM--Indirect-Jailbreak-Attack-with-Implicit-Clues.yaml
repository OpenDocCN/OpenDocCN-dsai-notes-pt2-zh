- en: With the development of LLMs, the security threats of LLMs are getting more
    and more attention. Numerous jailbreak attacks have been proposed to assess the
    security defense of LLMs. Current jailbreak attacks primarily utilize scenario
    camouflage techniques. However, their explicit mention of malicious intent will
    be easily recognized and defended by LLMs. In this paper, we propose an indirect
    jailbreak attack approach, Puzzler, which can bypass the LLM’s defensive strategies
    and obtain malicious responses by implicitly providing LLMs with some clues about
    the original malicious query. In addition, inspired by the wisdom of “When unable
    to attack, defend” from Sun Tzu’s Art of War, we adopt a defensive stance to gather
    clues about the original malicious query through LLMs. The experimental results
    indicate that the Query Success Rate of the Puzzler is 14.0%-82.7% higher than
    baselines on the most prominent LLMs. Furthermore, when tested against the state-of-the-art
    jailbreak detection approaches, Puzzler proves to be more effective at evading
    detection compared to baselines.

- en: Large Language Models (LLMs) are Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems for processing
    and generating human-like content, tightly integrating humans with AI through
    question-and-answer interactions. Due to its remarkable abilities in content comprehension
    and logical reasoning, notable LLMs such as ChatGPT OpenAI ([2022](#bib.bib17)),
    Gemini-pro Google ([2023](#bib.bib9)), and LLama Touvron et al. ([2023](#bib.bib21))
    have shown superior capabilities in a variety of downstream tasks and universal
    chatbot Penedo et al. ([2023](#bib.bib18)); Wang et al. ([2023a](#bib.bib22)).
    However, alongside the advancements in LLMs, there are growing concerns about
    their security threats, such as generating biases, providing unethical guidance,
    and producing content that contravenes societal values Abid et al. ([2021](#bib.bib2));
    Liu et al. ([2023b](#bib.bib15)); Hazell ([2023](#bib.bib10)); Liu et al. ([2023a](#bib.bib14));
    Li et al. ([2024](#bib.bib12)); Deng et al. ([2024](#bib.bib7)). In response to
    these challenges, LLM developers set up multiple defensive strategies within the
    LLMs to mitigate this threat and align the output of LLMs with human values, which
    refers to the LLM alignment Zhou et al. ([2023](#bib.bib28)); Wang et al. ([2023b](#bib.bib23)).

    alignment of LLMs by constructing malicious prompts specifically engineered to
    elicit malicious responses from LLMs, which are called jailbreak attacks Wei et al.
    ([2023](#bib.bib24)). The earlier practice of jailbreak attacks involved manually
    constructing specific scenario templates in the prompts to communicate with LLMs
    in a way that made them believe it was reasonable to respond to any queries within
    that scenario Ding et al. ([2023](#bib.bib8)); Liu et al. ([2023b](#bib.bib15));
    Li et al. ([2023b](#bib.bib13)). However, these manually created templates based
    on scenario camouflage can be easily defended against by restricting the responses
    to known templates. To overcome this limitation, later studies have employed a
    learnable strategy to automatically design jailbreak templates that can bypass
    the defense mechanisms of LLMs. For example, researchers such as Deng et al. ([2023](#bib.bib6))
    and Yu et al. ([2023](#bib.bib25)) utilize the LLMs to learn from existing prompts
    and generate the jailbreak prompts that reflect various new scenarios. Although
    the automatically generated scenario templates pose a greater challenge for defense,
    they directly convey malicious intent within the prompts. As shown in Figure [1](#S1.F1
    "Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Play Guessing Game with LLM: Indirect Jailbreak Attack
    with Implicit Clues"), LLMs can easily identify the malicious intent of the query
    as “steal from a store”. Consequently, these jailbreak prompts may be ineffective
    against the latest released LLMs.'

- en: 'In comparison to jailbreak attacks that explicitly express malicious intent
    as mentioned earlier, we have observed that providing certain clues or hints of
    the original malicious intent can bypass the defensive strategies of LLMs while
    still acquiring the required malicious response. As illustrated in Figure [1](#S1.F1
    "Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Play Guessing Game with LLM: Indirect Jailbreak Attack
    with Implicit Clues"), when we provide associated behaviors such as “time my visit
    during the store’s busiest hours” and “study the layout of the store”, LLMs have
    the capability to infer the underlying intent of “steal from a store” and generate
    the desired output. Importantly, since this does not explicitly convey the malicious
    intent, i.e., each clue is not sufficient to reveal the intent of the original
    malicious query, traditional safety alignment mechanisms of LLMs struggle to defend
    against these types of attacks. This can be likened to playing a “guessing game”
    with the LLM, where we provide verbal descriptions as hints without directly revealing
    the answer.'

    It is akin to launching a direct attack on the LLMs when we approach them with
    direct queries. As Sun Tzu wisely stated in The Art of War, “When unable to attack,
    defend.” In light of this wisdom, we initially assume a defensive stance when
    interacting with the LLMs. By adopting this defensive viewpoint, we prevent the
    LLMs from blocking our queries and instead encourage them to generate a diverse
    set of defensive measures in response to the original malicious intent. Building
    upon this defensive foundation, we can inquire about the offensive aspects of
    the defensive measures, which still fall outside the safety alignment mechanisms
    of the LLMs, thereby successfully obtaining the aforementioned clues of the malicious
    intent.

    diverse set of defensive measures, then acquire the corresponding offensive measures
    from LLMs. By presenting LLMs with these offensive measures (i.e., the clues of
    the original malicious query), we prompt them to speculate on the true intent
    hidden within the fragmented information and output the malicious answer.

    et al. ([2023](#bib.bib5)) and MaliciousInstructions Bianchi et al. ([2023](#bib.bib3))
    datasets and assessed performance on four closed-source LLMs (GPT3.5, GPT4, GPT4-Turbo,
    Gemini-pro) and two open-source LLMs (LLama-7B, LLama-13B). The performance is
    evaluated from two aspects, i.e., the Following Rate of the jailbreak responses
    and the Query Success Rate. For the former, we manually evaluate whether the jailbreak’s
    responses follow the original query, and for the latter, we determine whether
    the response from the LLM contravenes its alignment principles. The experimental
    results show that the Query Success Rate of Puzzler significantly outperforms
    that of baselines. In addition, the responses generated by Puzzler achieve a Following
    Rate of over 85.0% with the original queries, indicating the effectiveness of
    the indirect jailbreak. Furthermore, we test the Puzzler and the baselines with
    two state-of-the-art jailbreak detection approaches, and the results show that
    Puzzler substantially outperforms the baselines in evading detection, demonstrating
    the stealthy nature of Puzzler. We provide the public reproduction package¹¹1https://anonymous.4open.science/r/IJBR-81A5.

    systematically categorized existing jailbreak prompts for LLMs into three categories:
    1) Pretending, which attempts to alter the conversational background or context
    while maintaining the same intention, e.g., converting the question-and-answer
    scenario into a game environment; 2) Attention Shifting, which aims at changing
    both the conversational background and intention, e.g., Shifting the attention
    of LLMs from answering malicious queries to completing a paragraph of text; 3)
    Privilege escalation, which seeks to directly circumvent the restrictions imposed
    by the LLM, e.g., elevating the LLM’s privileges to let it answer malicious queries.
    Ding et al. ([2023](#bib.bib8)) first rewrote the original prompts to change their
    representation based on the assumption of altering the feature representation
    of the original sentences, while keeping the original semantics unchanged. Specific
    methods included performing partial translation or misspelling sensitive words,
    etc. Then, they incorporated the revised prompts into designed Attention Shifting
    templates for jailbreak LLMs. Li et al. ([2023b](#bib.bib13)) leveraged the personification
    ability of LLMs to construct novel nested Pretending templates, paving the way
    for further direct jailbreak possibilities.'

    automated the generation of adversarial suffixes by combining greedy and gradient-based
    search techniques, and suffixes appended to the original malicious query can prompt
    large language models to recognize the importance of the original query, thereby
    eliciting a response. Chao et al. ([2023](#bib.bib5)) used an attacker LLM to
    automatically generate jailbreaks for a separate targeted LLM. Given the attacker
    LLM iteratively queries the target LLM, updating and improving the existing jailbreak
    prompts based on the feedback. Specifically, the attacker LLM attempts to construct
    plausible scenarios from various angles to test the LLM’s receptiveness, such
    as disguising instructions for poisoning as a crucial step in cracking a criminal
    case. Mehrotra et al. ([2023](#bib.bib16)) built upon Chao et al. ([2023](#bib.bib5))
    achieves LLM jailbreak with fewer queries by incorporating the Tree of Thought
    framework for querying the targeted LLM and introducing evaluators to prune jailbreak
    prompts, which diverge from the original malicious query generated by the attacker
    LLM.

    idea is to package the original malicious query within a non-malicious scenario
    (or context), to divert the LLM’s attention and neglect the malicious content
    in the jailbreak prompts. With the rapid iteration of LLM’s own understanding,
    reasoning, and defense capabilities, the attacks based on the scenario camouflage
    are gradually becoming ineffective, as they still explicitly mention the easily
    perceived malicious intent. Based on this, our approach attempts to represent
    the malicious intent of the malicious query implicitly.

    content for the original query. Subsequently, GPT-4 Turbo is used to generate
    defensive measures for the malicious content and to evaluate these measures. Then,
    GPT-3.5 is utilized to generate offensive measures for the defensive measures.
    After that, for each dataset, Puzzler generates jailbreak prompts based on the
    malicious queries. We maintained the default configuration of GPT-3.5, GPT-4,
    and GPT-4 Turbo with temperature = 1 and $top\_n$ = 1⁵⁵5More details can be found

    and open-source LLM models. Then, we assess the performance of these jailbreak
    prompts from two perspectives: effectiveness and quality. For effectiveness, the
    key is to judge whether each generated prompt is a successful jailbreak. To this
    end, we build a team of three authors as members to manually annotate. Given a
    query, following the judgment standard in Ding et al. ([2023](#bib.bib8)), each
    member manually judges, and a generated prompt is considered a successful jailbreak
    attack only if all three members generally agree that the corresponding responses
    from LLMs contain any potential negativity, immorality, or illegality contents.
    Finally, we use Query Success Rate (QSR), the ratio of successful jailbreak queries
    to all jailbreak queries, which is the commonly-used metric in the jailbreaking
    attack Deng et al. ([2023](#bib.bib6)) to the effectiveness of Puzzler. Since
    Puzzler employs an indirect approach, which may introduce threats of misalignment
    between the answers and the original query, we further introduce the Following
    Rate (FR) as a metric to determine if the responses align with the intent of the
    original query. FR is defined as the ratio of jailbreak responses that follow
    the instructions of the jailbreak queries out of all jailbreak responses, serving
    as a metric to assess the quality of the generated jailbreak response. For a jailbreak
    response from LLM, it is considered positive only if all three members agree that
    the response aligns with the original query.'

    is 57.9%-82.7% higher than baselines. Compared to the automated baseline, the
    QSR of Puzzler is 69.9% higher than the TAP and the Following Rate is 10.4% higher
    than it. Specifically, TAP rewrites the original query and places it within a
    plausible scenario to elicit a response from the LLM. However, the results indicate
    that with the advancement of commercial LLM versions, TAP’s QSR significantly
    decreases, suggesting that LLMs are becoming more adept at discerning malicious
    intent and are less likely to respond to prompts that are inherently malevolent,
    even when presented within a reasonable scenario. Besides, the responses from
    the LLM are constrained by the scenario set by TAP, leading to deviations from
    the original query and thereby reducing its Following Rate. Compared to the manual
    baselines, the QSR of the method is 70.6% higher than them. It is noteworthy that
    the CR achieves an extremely high QSR on GPT-3.5, reaching 93.0%, indicating that
    GPT-3.5 has vulnerabilities with this type of jailbreak prompt. However, with
    the advancement of GPT versions, the QSR of CR significantly decreases, indicating
    that the LLMs have fixed these vulnerabilities. The other two approaches also
    demonstrate a similar trend across the GPT series. For the Gemini-pro LLM, CR
    achieves a QSR of 54.5%, which is significantly higher than the other two manual
    baselines. This indicates that CR has a certain degree of generalization in closed-source
    LLMs.

    higher than baselines. However, compared to closed-source LLMs, the QSR of Puzzler
    decreased by 79.6%. Through data observation, we found that open-source LLMs are
    highly sensitive to prompts containing content from publicly reported jailbreak
    templates, and they are very likely to refuse responses to prompts with such sensitive
    words, even if benign queries are added to the jailbreak template. This phenomenon
    is particularly evident on LLama2-7B-chat, resulting in Puzzler and baselines
    being unable to jailbreak it. Although this overprotection phenomenon can protect
    LLMs from attacks, it may affect their usability to some extent. However, there
    was some improvement on LLama2-13B-chat, it enhanced the balance between performance
    and safety alignment, moving away from a one-size-fits-all refusal to prompts
    containing sensitive words. However, compared with the baselines, Puzzler still
    shows the best QSR and Following Rate.

    variants and then observe the LLM’s responses to these variants. If the LLM refuses
    to respond to the majority of the variants, the original prompt is considered
    a jailbreak prompt. However, Puzzler can effectively avoid the LLM’s safety alignments,

    is 18.0%-62.0% lower than the ACC achieved on other baselines. JailGuard operates
    on a principle similar to SmoothLLM, where it generates multiple variants of the
    original prompt and observes the responses from the LLM to these variants. However,
    what sets JailGuard apart is that it vectorizes the content of the responses and
    performs a heatmap analysis. The original prompt is determined to be a jailbreak
    prompt based on the divergence observed in the heatmap. This means that if a few
    variants lead to a refusal to respond by the LLM, the difference in the heatmap
    will be quite pronounced, resulting in the original prompt being classified as
    a jailbreak prompt. Consequently, Puzzler has 38.0% of its prompts detected as
    jailbreak prompts, and the baselines are also identified more accurately. Overall,
    Puzzler can effectively evade current detection approaches. Future jailbreak detection
    methods could incorporate monitoring for the underlying intent of the prompt,
    providing insights for subsequent research.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This paper presents an indirect approach (Puzzler) to jailbreak LLMs by implicitly
    expressing malicious intent. Puzzler first combines the wisdom of “When unable
    to attack, defend” by querying the defensive measures of the original query and
    attacking them to obtain clues related to the original query. Subsequently, it
    bypasses the LLM’s safety alignment mechanisms by implicitly expressing the malicious
    intent of the original query through the combination of diverse clues. The experimental
    results indicate that the Query Success Rate of the Puzzler is 14.0%-82.7% higher
    than baselines on the most prominent LLMs. Moreover, when tested against the two
    state-of-the-art jailbreak detection approaches, only 21.0% jailbreak prompts
    generated by Puzzler are detected, which is more effective at evading detection
    compared to baselines.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are two limitations to the current study. Firstly, using LLMs to generate
    defensive and offensive measures might result in the LLM refusing to respond.
    Since the defensive prompts contain malicious content, even if the overall semantics
    of the defense prompts are positive, the LLM may refuse to answer queries related
    to the malicious content. As for offensive prompts, which inherently possess a
    low degree of malicious intent. With the improvement of the LLM safety alignment,
    LLM could refuse to respond to these prompts, even if they are structured within
    a jailbreak template.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Secondly, Puzzler is an indirect form of jailbreaking attack, which may result
    in responses that deviate from the original query. To ensure that the answers
    align as closely as possible with the original query, we processed the original
    query by extracting only the malicious content from it and then crafting offensive
    measures based on that content. Additionally, we pruned the defensive measures
    to ensure that the generated offensive measures are relevant to the behaviors
    associated with the original query. Finally, we evaluated the MatchRate between
    the jailbreak response and the original query, achieving a match rate of over
    85%.

    malicious query, we found that on average, 12 defensive measures could be generated
    for each malicious query, with 9 offensive measures being produced. This shows
    the validity of Puzzler and that the design of pruning the defensive measures
    in Puzzler plays a significant role in reducing the generation of unnecessary
    offensive measures.
