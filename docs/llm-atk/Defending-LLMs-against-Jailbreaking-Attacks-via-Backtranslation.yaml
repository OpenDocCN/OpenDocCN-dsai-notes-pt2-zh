- en: 'Although many large language models (LLMs) have been trained to refuse harmful
    requests, they are still vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks, which rewrite the
    original prompt to conceal its harmful intent. In this paper, we propose a new
    method for defending LLMs against jailbreaking attacks by “backtranslation”. Specifically,
    given an initial response generated by the target LLM from an input prompt, our
    backtranslation prompts a language model to infer an input prompt that can lead
    to the response. The inferred prompt is called the backtranslated prompt which
    tends to reveal the actual intent of the original prompt, since it is generated
    based on the LLM’s response and is not directly manipulated by the attacker. We
    then run the target LLM again on the backtranslated prompt, and we refuse the
    original prompt if the model refuses the backtranslated prompt. We explain that
    the proposed defense provides several benefits on its effectiveness and efficiency.
    We empirically demonstrate that our defense significantly outperforms the baselines,
    in the cases that are hard for the baselines, and our defense also has little
    impact on the generation quality for benign input prompts.¹¹1Code will be available

- en: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown LLMs’ extensive
    applications and transformative potential to reshape people’s lives (Touvron et al.,
    [2023a](#bib.bib15); OpenAI, [2023](#bib.bib12); Chowdhery et al., [2022](#bib.bib6);
    Chiang et al., [2023](#bib.bib5)). Alongside significant improvements in their
    overall capabilities across various tasks, efforts have been made to align them
    with human intentions and values, where LLMs must not only understand and follow
    human instructions but also refrain from generating unethical or illegal content
    that could pose harm to the society.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While commercial and open-source LLMs are typically fine-tuned to refuse harmful
    requests (Bai et al., [2022](#bib.bib3); OpenAI, [2023](#bib.bib12); Touvron et al.,
    [2023b](#bib.bib16)), they remain vulnerable to adversarial prompts (Zou et al.,
    [2023](#bib.bib28); Wei et al., [2023](#bib.bib17); Chao et al., [2023](#bib.bib4);
    Zhou et al., [2024](#bib.bib25); Zhu et al., [2023](#bib.bib27); Liu et al., [2023b](#bib.bib11);
    Yu et al., [2023](#bib.bib20); Lapid et al., [2023](#bib.bib9); Xu et al., [2023](#bib.bib19);
    Zeng et al., [2024](#bib.bib21)). Adversarial prompts are adversarially constructed
    to attack and *jailbreak* LLMs, such that target LLMs fail to refuse harmful requests
    in adversarial prompts and instead generate harmful responses.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this paper, we propose a simple and lightweight method for defending against
    jailbreaking attacks on LLMs. We assume that the target LLM has been trained with
    safety alignment and is normally able to refuse *clean* harmful prompts (i.e.,
    harmful prompts that are normally written, without an adversarial construction
    or a specific intent of jailbreaking), but the model may still generate a harmful
    response given an *adversarial* harmful prompt manipulated by attackers. Given
    an initial response generated by the target model, we in turn prompt a language
    model to infer the possible prompt, termed as the “backtranslated prompt”, that
    can lead to the response. We prompt the target LLM again to generate a second
    response given the backtranslated prompt, and we check if the model refuses the
    backtranslated prompt in the second response. We refuse the original prompt if
    the backtranslated prompt is refused by the target model. The backtranslated prompt
    tends to recover the harmful intent in the original prompt from the initial response,
    while it is a relatively *clean* prompt in contrast to the original *adversarial*
    prompt and thus easier for a safety-aligned model to refuse.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Compared to existing defense methods (Jain et al., [2023](#bib.bib7); Robey
    et al., [2023](#bib.bib14)), our new defense by backtranslation enjoys several
    benefits. First, it operates on the response generated by the target model rather
    than the prompt that can be directly manipulated by attackers, and thus our defense
    tends to be more robust to adversarial prompts and harder to be attacked. Second,
    our defense leverages the inherent ability of the target model to refuse harmful
    requests in the original generation task, and it does not require specifically
    training the target model for an additional task, such as detecting a harmful
    request as a classification or regression task. Third, our defense has no impact
    on the generation for benign requests, as long as the backtranslated prompt is
    not refused. Fourth, our defense is cheap as it does not require any additional
    training, and it is efficient during the inference as it does not require many
    queries and we can use a relatively cheap model for the backtranslation. Our experiments
    empirically demonstrate the advantages of our defense method which achieves superior
    defense success rate against adversarial prompts, while it is also able to maintain
    the generation quality on benign data.

    that jailbreak LLMs. Among them, GCG (Zou et al., [2023](#bib.bib28)) generated
    adversarial suffixes that are concatenated to the input prompt, by a combined
    greedy and gradient-based optimization; AutoDAN (Liu et al., [2023a](#bib.bib10))
    used a genetic algorithm to optimize for an adversarial prompt; PAIR (Chao et al.,
    [2023](#bib.bib4)) generated jailbreaks by iteratively querying the target model
    and refining the prompt with only black-box access to the target model. PAP (Zeng
    et al., [2024](#bib.bib21)) developed persuasive paraphrasers to generate persuasive
    adversarial prompts. In addition to these attacks that can optimize prompts on
    each individual model or example, there are also attacks that consist of manually
    designed adversarial prefixes or suffixes (Wei et al., [2023](#bib.bib17)) that
    are fixed. As various jailbreaking attacks emerge, it is important to address
    such vulnerabilities of LLMs by designing defense methods.

    Detection-based methods aim to identify and reject adversarial prompts, e.g.,
    by a perplexity filter (Jain et al., [2023](#bib.bib7); Alon and Kamfonas, [2023](#bib.bib2)),
    but some jailbreaking methods generate adversarial prompts that are more natural
    and stealthy (Liu et al., [2023a](#bib.bib10); Zhu et al., [2023](#bib.bib27))
    for detection-based methods. Denoising-based methods essentially aim to mitigate
    the adversarial component in an adversarial prompt, by paraphrasing (Jain et al.,
    [2023](#bib.bib7); Zhou et al., [2024](#bib.bib25)), retokenization (Jain et al.,
    [2023](#bib.bib7)) or random perturbations (Robey et al., [2023](#bib.bib14);
    Kumar et al., [2023](#bib.bib8)). Prompt engineering methods manually design prompts
    that aim to remind the target model of safety guidelines (Xie et al., [2023](#bib.bib18);
    Zhang et al., [2023](#bib.bib22)). There are also defense methods that automatically
    optimize prompts (Zhou et al., [2024](#bib.bib25); Zheng et al., [2024](#bib.bib23)).
    These defenses commonly operate on prompts which attackers can directly manipulate.
    In contrast, our proposed defense operates on the response generated by the target
    model and backtranslates the response. Moreover, our defense does not require
    additional optimization or making many queries, and thus it is cheap and efficient.

    in [Section 4.1](#S4.SS1 "4.1 Backtranslation ‣ 4 Defense by Backtranslation ‣
    Defending LLMs against Jailbreaking Attacks via Backtranslation"), we introduce
    our backtranslation process which backtranslates an initial response and infers
    a possible user prompt that can lead to the response. The backtranslated prompt
    is expected to naturally mitigate the adversarial component in the original prompt,
    as it is constructed from the initial response which is generated by the target
    model rather than directly provided by the attacker. In [Section 4.2](#S4.SS2
    "4.2 Defended Response with Backtranslation ‣ 4 Defense by Backtranslation ‣ Defending
    LLMs against Jailbreaking Attacks via Backtranslation"), we leverage the backtranslated
    prompt to return a defended response, by checking if the target model refuses
    the backtranslated prompt. In [Section 4.3](#S4.SS3 "4.3 Cost of Backtranslation
    ‣ 4 Defense by Backtranslation ‣ Defending LLMs against Jailbreaking Attacks via
    Backtranslation"), we discuss the cost of the backtranslation. Moreover, in [Section 4.4](#S4.SS4
    "4.4 Mitigating Over-refusal ‣ 4 Defense by Backtranslation ‣ Defending LLMs against
    Jailbreaking Attacks via Backtranslation"), we also filter backtranslated prompts
    and skip unreasonable ones, to mitigate over-refusal due to unsatisfactory backtranslated
    prompts. [Algorithm 1](#alg1 "In 4 Defense by Backtranslation ‣ Defending LLMs
    against Jailbreaking Attacks via Backtranslation") illustrates our proposed defense

    of various defense methods against GCG, PAIR, AutoDAN, and PAP, respectively.
    The results demonstrate that our defense by backtranslation is highly effective
    and our backtranslation is typically able to outperform existing defense methods
    when the DSRs of the baselines are low. For example, on PAIR with GPT-3.5-turbo
    as the target model, when PAIR is not aware of the defense (“w/o defense” in the
    table), the best baseline (paraphrase) achieves a DSR of 78% while our backtranslation
    achieves 88%; when PAIR is aware of the defense (“w/ defense” in the table), the
    best baseline (paraphrase) achieves a DSR of 64% while our backtranslation achieves
    76%. Our backtranslation achieves the lowest DSR on the setting with PAIR (w/
    defense) and Vicuna-13B, with a DSR of 56%. Defense in this setting is relatively
    more difficult, as PAIR leverages the defended model and is thus relatively strong,
    and Vicuna has relatively weak safety alignment as mentioned in [Section 5.1](#S5.SS1
    "5.1 Settings ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ Defending LLMs against Jailbreaking Attacks via
    Backtranslation"). Nonetheless, our backtranslation still significantly outperforms
    SmoothLLM (DSR 2%) and paraphrase (DSR 4%).

    have little impact on the generation quality, as the average response quality
    only drops slightly for these two defenses, compared to the case when no defense
    is added. In contrast, SmoothLLM downgrades the generation quality much more,
    as its returned response is generated from a perturbed prompt (with a prompt perturbation
    such as character swapping). For “response check”, we find that it only works
    on GPT-3.5-turbo with little impact on the generation quality, while on Llama-2-13B-Chat
    or Vicuna-13B, the target models have difficulty following the instruction on
    rating the harmfulness of the response, or may require more extensive prompt engineering,

    response generated by the undefended model. The target model is able to refuse
    the backtranslated prompt given the clearly harmful intent in the backtranslated

    defends against the jailbreaking attack. We show examples on other attacks in

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this paper, we propose a novel defense against LLM jailbreaking attacks by
    backtranslation. Our defense operates on the initial response by backtranslation
    and it leverages the inherent ability to refuse harmful prompts of safety-aligned
    LLMs in a generation task. We demonstrate that our defense is highly effective
    for defending against the existing jailbreak attacks and it outperforms the existing
    jailbreaking defense baselines. Our defense is also efficient and lightweight,
    and it is able to mostly maintain the generation quality on benign input prompts.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There remain a few limitations in this work. First of all, the effectiveness
    of backtranslation relies on the assumption that the model without defense is
    able to refuse clean harmful requests. Backtranslation may not be effective if
    the model is never trained with safety alignment. Second, while our defense is
    usually able to maintain the general quality, the generation quality is still
    slightly downgraded due to possible errors in the backtranslation. Future works
    may investigate more accurate backtranslation for the jailbreaking defense. Besides,
    although we have tested our defense against PAIR in the defense-aware setting
    (PAIR is attacking the whole system including both the model and our defense),
    we have not tested it against white-box attacks (e.g., GCG, AutoDAN) in such a
    setting as those attacks rely on output probability which is nontrivial to define
    with backtranslation. Future works may design stronger white-box attacks by considering
    the effect of backtranslation in the defense, to further stress test our defense
    and inspire stronger jailbreaking defenses.

    attacks on Llama-2-13B and Vicuna-13B, we use the setting with “individual harmful
    behaviors” where an adversarial prompt is optimized on each individual example
    of harmful request, and we take 200 optimization steps on each example for a trade-off
    the effectiveness of the attack and computational cost. For the attack on GPT-3.5-turbo,
    we use the transfer attack setting, where each adversarial suffix is optimized
    on 25 examples by 500 optimization steps, and following the concatenation setting
    in Zou et al. ([2023](#bib.bib28)), we concatenate 4 adversarial suffixes that
    are optimized on Vicuna and Guanacos, respectively (2 adversarial suffixes from
    each target model using 2 different random seeds).
