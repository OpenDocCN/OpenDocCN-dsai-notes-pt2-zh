- en: Misuse of the Large Language Models (LLMs) has raised widespread concern. To
    address this issue, safeguards have been taken to ensure that LLMs align with
    social ethics. However, recent findings have revealed an unsettling vulnerability
    bypassing the safeguards of LLMs, known as jailbreak attacks. By applying techniques,
    such as employing role-playing scenarios, adversarial examples, or subtle subversion
    of safety objectives as a prompt, LLMs can produce an inappropriate or even harmful
    response. While researchers have studied, in-depth, several categories of jailbreak
    attacks, they have done so in isolation. To fill this gap, we present the first
    large-scale measurement of various jailbreak attack methods. We concentrate on
    13 cutting-edge jailbreak methods from four categories, 160 questions from 16
    violation categories, and six popular LLMs. Our extensive experimental results
    demonstrate that the optimized jailbreak prompts consistently achieve the highest
    attack success rates, as well as exhibit robustness across different LLMs. Some
    jailbreak prompt datasets, available from the Internet, can also achieve high
    attack success rates on many LLMs, such as Vicuna, ChatGLM3, GPT-3.5, and PaLM2.
    Despite the claims from many organizations regarding the coverage of violation
    categories in their policies, the attack success rates from these categories remain
    high, indicating the challenges of effectively aligning LLM policies and the ability
    to counter jailbreak attacks. We also discuss the trade-off between the attack
    performance and efficiency, as well as show that the transferability of the jailbreak
    prompts is still viable, becoming an option for black-box models. Overall, our
    research highlights the necessity of evaluating different jailbreak methods. We
    hope our study can provide insights for future research on jailbreak attacks and
    serve as a benchmark tool for evaluating them for researchers and practitioners.

    myriad domains. Nevertheless, these models, for all their potential, have engendered
    concerns owing to instances of misuse [[64](#bib.bib64), [35](#bib.bib35), [29](#bib.bib29),
    [52](#bib.bib52)]. In response to this issue, various regulations have emerged,
    such as the European Union’s AI Act [[1](#bib.bib1)], the United States’ Blueprint
    for an AI Bill of Rights [[2](#bib.bib2)], the United Kingdom’s innovative AI
    regulation strategy [[3](#bib.bib3)], and China’s Measures for the Management
    of Generative Artificial Intelligence Services [[4](#bib.bib4)]. All these regulations
    aim at overseeing the development and deployment of LLMs and limiting the risk
    of misuse. Meanwhile, LLM-related service providers, such as Meta [[5](#bib.bib5)]
    and OpenAI [[6](#bib.bib6)], are constantly updating their usage policies and
    are incorporating methods such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF)
    to ensure LLMs’ alignment with human ethics and intended usage [[56](#bib.bib56),
    [49](#bib.bib49)].

    various methods to bypass the security mechanisms of LLMs and induce them to produce
    content that violates usage policies. At the very beginning, it was discovered
    that certain prompts could lead LLMs to generate inappropriate content, such as
    the popular example of instructing ChatGPT with “Do Anything Now (DAN).”¹¹1[https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/02/14/chatgpt-dan-jailbreak/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/02/14/chatgpt-dan-jailbreak/).
    Subsequently, more and more prompts of this nature have been discovered, either
    intentionally or unintentionally. These prompts are referred to as jailbreak prompts
    in the wild [[53](#bib.bib53)]. Parallel with jailbreak prompts in the wild, researchers
    have also been exploring methods for automatically generating jailbreak prompts,
    such as GCG [[65](#bib.bib65)], GPTfuzz [[62](#bib.bib62)], and AutoDAN [[38](#bib.bib38)].
    As shown in [Figure 1](#S1.F1 "Figure 1 ‣ Introduction ‣ Comprehensive Assessment
    of Jailbreak Attacks Against LLMs"), these methods have attempted to exploit vulnerabilities
    in LLM security safeguards and leverage strategies such as using low-resource
    languages or engaging in clever role-playing scenarios. There is even research
    suggesting that, without any additional prompts, high success-rate jailbreak attacks
    can be carried out on well-aligned LLMs. Despite the endlessly emerging jailbreak
    methods, there is currently lacking a systematic and comprehensive fair benchmark
    for these jailbreak methods. In particular, previous works [[42](#bib.bib42),
    [24](#bib.bib24)] often compare with a limited set of jailbreak methods, and the
    experimental setups do not ensure alignment.

    more effectively. Thus we took great care to share our findings responsibly. We
    disclosed our findings to the involved LLM service providers, including OpenAI,

    aptitude for understanding external information, such as in-context learning [[43](#bib.bib43)],
    and their proficiency in utilizing search engines like Bing with Copilot.²²2[https://copilot.microsoft.com/](https://copilot.microsoft.com/).
    However, the abundance of training data exposes LLMs to the risk of obtaining
    and distributing potentially harmful or unsafe knowledge. Adversaries exploit
    these capabilities to launch a variety of attacks, notably prompt injection [[17](#bib.bib17)]
    and jailbreak attacks [[53](#bib.bib53), [27](#bib.bib27), [24](#bib.bib24), [38](#bib.bib38),

    safety guard techniques, including reinforcement learning from human feedback
    (RLHF) [[20](#bib.bib20), [18](#bib.bib18)] and red teaming [[50](#bib.bib50)].

- en: Jailbreak attacks refer to a scenario where a user intentionally tries to trick
    or manipulate the LLMs to bypass their built-in safety, ethical, or operational
    guidelines. They aim to make the model behave in ways designed to avoid, such
    as generating inappropriate content, disclosing sensitive information, or performing
    actions against programming constraints. Currently, the majority of jailbreak
    attacks are accomplished through the creation of “jailbreak prompts.” These prompts
    are specialized inputs that exploit potential loopholes or weaknesses in the LLMs.
    Researchers have proposed various approaches for identifying or crafting jailbreak
    prompts, including collecting them from real-world scenarios [[53](#bib.bib53)],
    manually creating them by guided strategies [[61](#bib.bib61), [59](#bib.bib59)],
    or automatic generation [[42](#bib.bib42), [26](#bib.bib26), [62](#bib.bib62),
    [24](#bib.bib24)]. Furthermore, the previous work [[32](#bib.bib32)] also found
    that the alignment of LLMs cannot cover all hyperparameters, which can result
    in generating harmful content under specific hyperparameter configurations without
    requiring the prompts.

    In the previous work [[53](#bib.bib53)], these prompts are also termed “jailbreak
    prompts in the wild.” These jailbreak prompts require no alteration to achieve
    the attack goal. In this scenario, the adversary is assumed to have black-box

    prompt sets in “Votes” from the above website.

    intentional approach that uses some non-English translation or obfuscation to
    jailbreak the LLMs. Unlike the prompts from human-based method, prompts in this
    category are often shorter, i.e., requiring fewer tokens. This is because such
    methods often exploit vulnerabilities in the alignment mechanism and require less
    modification to obtain jailbreak prompts, such as translating English text to
    Zulu text. The adversary is assumed to have black-box access to the LLMs. Here,
    we select three common jailbreak methods.

    [48](#bib.bib48), [8](#bib.bib8)] have the ability to recognize the Base64 encoding.
    In this approach, the prompt is obfuscated through Base64 encoding to bypass the
    safety mechanisms of LLMs.

    to synthesize different jailbreak methods together, such as Base64 encoding, prefix
    injection (requires LLMs to start the answer with a specific prefix), and style
    injection (requires LLMs’ answers to follow a specific style). Previous work [[59](#bib.bib59)]
    has demonstrated a good attack performance when leveraging the combination jailbreak
    prompts.

    of non-English datasets, including low-resource languages like Zulu. In general,
    due to linguistic inequality during the safety training of LLMs, jailbreak prompts
    in low-resource languages can easily evade the safety mechanisms of LLMs. Therefore,
    the adversaries utilize Zulu, through the translation of English jailbreak prompts,
    as an effective approach to achieve their attack goals.

    of the term “step.” For instance, GCG reports the number of optimizing epochs
    as the step, while TAP sets the total count of queries to the target LLMs as the
    step. Note that, for TAP, there are still some queries to the *evaluator* from
    the generated response candidates. Therefore, it is unfair to directly compare
    the steps defined in different jailbreak methods. To address this, we adopt a
    general definition of “step” in our experiments. For the methods employing another
    LLM to modify jailbreak prompts, each modification of the prompts is regarded
    as one step. We set the maximum number of modification steps for each forbidden
    question to 50. In addition, we refer to the steps in GCG as “gcg_step” and set
    its number to 500, along with a batch size of 128. For Generation Exploitation,

    of average ASR scores across different factors in jailbreak attacks, including
    the unified policy and the attack taxonomy. We first provide a fine-grained analysis
    of the effectiveness of different jailbreak attacks based on our attack taxonomy
    (see [Section 6.1](#S6.SS1 "Evaluation of Attack Taxonomy ‣ Experiment Results
    ‣ Comprehensive Assessment of Jailbreak Attacks Against LLMs")). Then, we introduce
    our experiment results from the perspective of our unified policy (see [Section 6.2](#S6.SS2

    of Jailbreak Attacks Against LLMs")). Finally, we study the relationship between
    our jailbreak attacks taxonomy and the unified policy (see [Section 6.3](#S6.SS3

    We observe that any of the six LLMs do not demonstrate initial resistance to harmful
    questions. For the well-aligned LLMs such as Llama2, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4, the ASR
    scores of baseline are 0.31, 0.44, and 0.38, respectively. We find that the average
    ASR of each LLM exceeds the baseline, indicating the overall vulnerability of
    all LLMs to jailbreak attacks. Among all the models, Vicuna is the most vulnerable
    to jailbreak attacks, which aligns with our conclusion related to the unified

    the obfuscation-based method, achieve high attack performance, as demonstrated
    in [Table 2](#S6.T2 "Table 2 ‣ Evaluation of Attack Taxonomy ‣ Experiment Results
    ‣ Comprehensive Assessment of Jailbreak Attacks Against LLMs"). After detailed
    analysis, we discern that all the obfuscation-based jailbreak attacks are model-specific
    attacks, i.e., they can achieve a high ASR score on a specific model, especially
    on GPT-4. For example, Zulu could only achieve good attack performance on GPT-3.5
    and GPT-4, with the ASR exceeding 0.75. We attribute this phenomenon to the strong
    capability of the LLM. LLMs like GPT-4, with their extensive training on diverse
    datasets, obtain the capacity to recognize and process texts that have been translated
    to low-resource languages or encoded, which is beyond the capability of other
    models. However, this capability is a double-edged sword, as it also enlarges
    the attack surface of the high-performance LLMs. The extra attack surface makes
    it harder to align such LLMs and increases their vulnerability to jailbreak attacks.
    Thus, the vulnerability is exploited by obfuscation-based jailbreak methods, and
    these methods could achieve significant attack performance against the specific
    LLMs.

    targeting all LLMs in the white-box setting. In addition, almost all white-box
    jailbreak attacks yield higher ASR results, except for GCG on ChatGLM3. A detailed
    analysis indicates that this failure may be attributed to the training dataset
    of ChatGLM3, which is across Chinese and English domains. GCG, however, which
    needs to calculate the coordinate gradient of the tokens, may fail to be resistant
    to this model.

    performance. To illustrate, AIM achieves exceeding 0.85 ASR scores – the highest

    and PaLM2. Notably, for the black-box scenario, we find that the human-based jailbreak
    prompts (also referred to as “in the wild” prompts) can still achieve high ASR
    in many cases, which highlights the significance of actively collecting and analyzing
    such jailbreak prompts. This underscores the robustness and effectiveness of human-based

    Results ‣ Comprehensive Assessment of Jailbreak Attacks Against LLMs") show that
    the ASR scores vary significantly across different violation categories from our
    unified policy. In general, Terrorist Content, Physical Harm, and Illegal Activities
    are the three most challenging categories to launch jailbreak attacks, whereas
    the Political Activities, Well-being Infringement, and AI Usage Disclosure are
    more straightforward and amenable to jailbreak attacks. To better understand the
    results of our policy, combined with [Table 10](#A1.T10 "Table 10 ‣ Appendix A
    Appendix ‣ Comprehensive Assessment of Jailbreak Attacks Against LLMs"), we conduct
    a fine-grained evaluation, analyzing the performance of various LLMs with our
    unified policy. Our results reveal that despite the usage policy from the model
    provider explicitly stating the coverage of violation categories, the ASR results
    continue to register a high score. For example, despite OpenAI’s explicit prohibition
    of Political Activities in their policy, the jailbreak attack within this category
    still manages to achieve the highest ASR (over 0.80) on GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. Meta
    and Google also experience a similar situation. This phenomenon underscores the
    challenges associated with effectively aligning LLM policies and their jailbreak
    attacks, indicating the future works for improvement in ensuring policy compliance
    within LLMs. In addition, some models, such as Vicuna and ChatGLM3, originally
    did not provide any usage policy. To mitigate the effectiveness of jailbreak attacks,
    we expect these model trainers to carry out targeted optimizations in subsequent
    updates according to our policy-based experimental statistics.

    (9 categories), GPT-3.5 (2 categories), and GPT-4 (6 categories). Therefore, we
    believe that although other models also suffer from jailbreak attacks across different
    violation categories, these three models are the most vulnerable. The potential
    reason is that for most attacks [[61](#bib.bib61), [62](#bib.bib62), [59](#bib.bib59)],
    their original targets are the LLMs of OpenAI, i.e., GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. As for
    the Vicuna, it does not implant any specific safeguards during the fine-tuning,
    and the dataset used is collected from ShareGPT⁴⁴4[https://sharegpt.com/](https://sharegpt.com/).

    poor performance across all violation categories in the policy, denoted by the
    negative correlation in the heatmap. Furthermore, the optimization-based and parameter-based
    jailbreak attacks are relatively robust and versatile among all the violation
    categories. Among all the human-based jailbreak methods, AIM is the most effective
    one from various categories of our policy. The above conclusions intuitively support
    the findings we presented previously (see [Section 6](#S6 "Experiment Results

    are only effective when deployed on GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 across all violation categories.

    ‣ Figure 5 ‣ Relationship Between Taxonomy and Policy ‣ Experiment Results ‣ Comprehensive

    exhibit attack success rates lower than or equal to 0.50 across all violation
    categories, and in the vast majority of cases, even lower than 0.10. However,
    on GPT-4 (see [5(b)](#S6.F5.sf2 "5(b) ‣ Figure 5 ‣ Relationship Between Taxonomy

    Against LLMs")), the Zulu attack demonstrates remarkable effectiveness, with attack
    success rates exceeding 0.50 across all violation categories except for *Privacy
    Breach*. This reiterates our previous findings in [Section 6.1](#S6.SS1 "Evaluation

    attacks. For different violation categories from our unified policy and jailbreak
    taxonomy, the attack performances vary. In general, Vicuna is the most vulnerable
    LLM based on both our unified policy and jailbreak attack taxonomy. White-box
    jailbreak attacks have a better performance on the LLMs. The human-based jailbreak
    method can still achieve a very high ASR score in the black-box scenario. Considering
    that many optimization-based methods start with human-based jailbreak prompts,
    the human-based jailbreak methods should receive more attention. For the relationship
    between the policy and attack taxonomy, the optimization-based and parameter-based
    jailbreak attacks are more robust among all the violation categories. Additionally,
    we hope that these organizations can further optimize based on their proposed
    policies to better mitigate jailbreak attacks.

    generation of jailbreak attacks along with the attack taxonomy. As we know, jailbreak
    attacks in human-based of obfuscation-based method only require a negligible amount
    of time for translation, optimization, or content modification. These attacks
    can be launched swiftly as they have been collected as a continuously updated
    dataset [[53](#bib.bib53)]. Therefore, we treat their time consumption as 0. On
    the other hand, optimization-based and parameter-based jailbreak attacks typically
    demand more time and computational resources to achieve a better attack performance.
    Therefore, it is important to consider the trade-off between attack effectiveness
    and time efficiency when evaluating jailbreak methods.

    Assessment of Jailbreak Attacks Against LLMs") demonstrate the time consumption
    of optimization-based and parameter-based method. GPTfuzz, using a relatively
    small local model for response evaluation and employing straightforward prompt
    mutation, indeed contributes to its minimal time consumption. In addition, [Table 4](#S7.T4
    "Table 4 ‣ Time Efficiency ‣ Ablation Study ‣ Comprehensive Assessment of Jailbreak
    Attacks Against LLMs") highlights that Generation Exploitation stands out for
    its efficiency of time cost, with the highest ASR among all the jailbreak attacks.
    This efficiency can be attributed to the fact that this method only generates
    50 responses without additional operations. On the other hand, GCG costs the longest
    run time. Note that our “gcg_step” is set to 500 with only a 0.62 average ASR
    score, but it still costs over three times more than AutoDAN and five times more
    than Generation Exploitation. Hence, we believe GCG is not an efficient method.
    Aside from GCG, other jailbreak attacks choose to use ChatGPT as the model for
    modifying and evaluating rewritten prompts. These methods will also incur unpredictable
    time consumption during the Internet connection process and response generation,
    which is an uncertain factor for qualifying efficiency. We can only provide a
    rough estimate that TAP may require more time compared to other methods using
    ChatGPT because it involves a higher number of calls to ChatGPT during its execution.'

    prompts in controlling costs when utilizing these models for jailbreaking. [Figure 6](#S7.F6
    "Figure 6 ‣ Token Numbers ‣ Ablation Study ‣ Comprehensive Assessment of Jailbreak
    Attacks Against LLMs") illustrates the token numbers of jailbreak prompts used
    in different methods in Llama2 and GPT-3.5. The results of other models are available

    of Jailbreak Attacks Against LLMs") in [Appendix A](#A1 "Appendix A Appendix ‣
    Comprehensive Assessment of Jailbreak Attacks Against LLMs"). The average token
    number of our baseline is the average token count of the forbidden questions,
    which is 14.78. Our results indicate that, for the black-box scenario, token counts
    of the human-based jailbreak prompt and many approaches used this prompt as the
    initial prompt are significantly larger than others. For instance, the average
    token count of all human-based methods reaches surprisingly 676.79, and even the
    shortest one, AIM, also has an average token count of 382.78. Those methods using
    the human-based jailbreak prompt as the initial seed, including AutoDAN, GPTfuzz,
    and Masterkey, also need a large number of tokens, with the average token counts
    all exceeding 250. In fact, human-based jailbreak methods often employ a comprehensive
    approach to bypass LLM safeguards. They systematically explore a wide range of
    conditions and incorporate them into the prompt, such as role-playing, repeated
    purpose, and output format.

    Study ‣ Comprehensive Assessment of Jailbreak Attacks Against LLMs") demonstrate
    the transfer attack of different categories of our attack taxonomy on the rest
    of LLMs. First and foremost, the transferred jailbreak prompt is still effective
    on the rest of the models but lower than the original attack performance. For
    example, the average ASR score of AutoDAN is 0.60, higher than the baseline (0.39)
    but much lower than the original attack performance in Vicuna (0.98). In addition,
    for the attacks with the white-box scenarios, transferring the jailbreak attack
    can provide an effective solution against the LLMs with only black-box access.
    To illustrate, when jailbreaking PaLM2, AutoDAN demonstrates a notable ASR score
    of 0.82, meaning that this attack method exhibits good transferability on this
    model.

    More specifically, TAP is extremely good at conducting transfer attacks on GPT-3.5

    GCG demonstrates the poorest transferability, with an average ASR of only 0.36,
    even falling below the baseline. This difference in transferability could potentially
    be attributed to the presence of similar corpora and training structures among
    the LLMs. Therefore, transferability often appears to operate at the semantic
    level rather than at the token level, as described in previous research [[38](#bib.bib38)].

    Against LLMs"). We also plot the heatmaps for each model in [Figure 8](#S7.F8

    under the transfer attack setting. We have observed that transfer attacks can
    boost the ASR across all challenging violation categories, including categories
    Illegal Activities, Privacy Breach, and Disinformation Spread, where the baseline
    ASRs are only 0.04, 0.06, and 0.06, respectively. Specifically, the average ASRs
    for transfer attacks in these categories have been increased to 0.31, 0.24, and
    0.33, respectively. Furthermore, we have also discovered that AutoDAN and TAP,
    which exhibit the best transferability, outperform or match the baseline performance
    across all violation subcategories. This suggests that these two methods have
    the potential to comprehensively enhance or maintain the attack success rate on
    various violation subcategories, demonstrating their significant capabilities.

    of AutoDAN and TAP. As depicted in [8(a)](#S7.F8.sf1 "8(a) ‣ Figure 8 ‣ Transferability
    ‣ Ablation Study ‣ Comprehensive Assessment of Jailbreak Attacks Against LLMs")
    and [8(b)](#S7.F8.sf2 "8(b) ‣ Figure 8 ‣ Transferability ‣ Ablation Study ‣ Comprehensive
    Assessment of Jailbreak Attacks Against LLMs"), transfer attacks conducted by
    AutoDAN and TAP have improved ASRs compared to the baseline across most violation
    subcategories on ChatGLM3 and GPT-4, respectively. It is particularly noteworthy
    that transfer attacks have shown strong attack effectiveness on certain violation
    categories that could lead to serious consequences. For instance, AutoDAN achieves
    an ASR success rate of 0.9 on Illegal Activities in ChatGLM3, while TAP achieves
    an ASR success rate of 0.6 on Terrorist Content in GPT-4. The high success rates
    of transfer attacks imply low-cost access to illicit resources or information,
    which is particularly concerning and warrants significant attention.

    the limitations and shortcomings of these evaluation methods. There are two main
    kinds of approaches to determining a jailbreak success:'

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'String Match: This approach is based on comparing the LLM output with a set
    of standard phrases. Specifically, if the response generated by the target LLM
    contains response strings like “sure,” it is considered a successful jailbreak.
    And if the response generated by the target LLM contains negative response strings
    like “sorry,” it is considered a failed jailbreak.'

    model, typically another LLM, as the judge model. This judge model is used to
    assess whether the response generated by the target LLM contains harmful content
    or answers violation questions. For each response, the judge model only gives
    a single overall label.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_IND
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Both of these methods have their respective limitations and thus usually misjudge
    some responses. The String Matching method has a narrow perspective, as the presence
    of a string like “sure” in a response does not necessarily indicate a successful
    jailbreak. Also, the inclusion of strings like “sorry” does not necessarily imply
    a jailbreak failure. The second kind of method, when assessing certain response
    patterns, may result in a higher rate of false positives by the judge model. For
    instance, if the response generated by the target LLM only consists of rephrased
    versions of prohibited questions, the judge model often erroneously identifies
    it as a successful jailbreak when the task is to assign a single label, even if
    the judge model itself is an advanced LLM.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: On the other hand, the developers of different jailbreak methods often deploy
    their own ASR evaluation methods to compare their jailbreak methods with other
    jailbreak methods. To some extent, such comparisons may be unfair and introduce
    biases. Detailedly, we have observed that some methods, during the optimization
    of jailbreak prompts, use evaluations of the target LLM’s responses by their judge
    model to determine when to terminate the loop. This implies that these methods
    are tailored to this specific judge model. Subsequently, they also employ the
    same judge model to evaluate the responses of the target LLM under other jailbreak
    methods, which are not necessarily customized for this particular judge model.
    In such cases, there may be biases in the comparison results.

    ASR evaluation method, aimed at serving as an impartial third-party arbiter and
    addressing the shortcomings of existing ASR evaluation methods, as we discuss
    above. Under the settings of [Section 5.3](#S5.SS3 "Evaluation Metrics ‣ Experiment
    Settings ‣ Comprehensive Assessment of Jailbreak Attacks Against LLMs"), we measure
    the evaluation accuracy for String Match and Judge Model (Single Label) to be
    75.63% and 67.03%, respectively, both of which are lower than our 94.84%. This
    implies that our evaluation method is more consistent with human annotations.

    compute resource requirements. In particular, white-box attack methods often demand
    higher configuration resources. For example, GCG is recommended to be run on configurations
    with one or multiple NVIDIA A100 GPUs. On the other hand, black-box attack methods
    (which only require API access) tend to have lower resource requirements, and
    in some cases, they may even require no GPUs. However, black-box attack methods
    may involve external network access. In our experiments, we considered a resource-enough
    attacker, meaning we met the minimum compute resource requirements for all methods
    by default.

    [54](#bib.bib54)]. Internal safety training, an extension of the alignment technology [[18](#bib.bib18)],
    involves several innovative approaches. One such approach is the development of
    a specialized safety reward model, seamlessly integrated into the Reinforcement
    Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) pipeline [[55](#bib.bib55), [56](#bib.bib56)].
    Additionally, the technique of context distillation on RLHF data [[18](#bib.bib18)]
    focuses on fine-tuning the LLM exclusively with responses deemed safe, thereby
    enhancing its reliability. Another noteworthy strategy is the Rejection Sampling
    method [[46](#bib.bib46)], which involves generating multiple responses, from
    which the reward model selects the least harmful one for fine-tuning the LLM,
    ensuring the output aligns with safety standards.'

    of text in conversations using external models. A prime example is the OpenAI
    moderation endpoint [[41](#bib.bib41)], which evaluates texts across 11 dimensions,
    including harassment and hate speech. This system exemplifies how external models
    can play a crucial role in maintaining conversational integrity. Moreover, some
    systems employ an additional LLM to oversee conversations. For instance, the OpenChatKit
    moderation model⁵⁵5[https://github.com/togethercomputer/OpenChatKit](https://github.com/togethercomputer/OpenChatKit).

    We integrate 13 state-of-the-art jailbreak attacks with four different method
    categories, namely human-based, obfuscation-based, optimization-based, and parameter-based
    method. In addition, we establish a unified policy containing 16 violation categories,
    combining five LLM-related service providers, i.e., Google, OpenAI, Meta, Amazon,
    and Microsoft. Guiding by the unified policy, we collect a forbidden question
    dataset with 160 questions (ten for each violation category) for our experiments.

- en: Through the lens of six popular LLMs, we holistically analyze the jailbreak
    attacks and find that optimization-based and parameter-based methods consistently
    exhibit the best attack performance and maintain robustness across all the LLMs.
    Human-based methods can achieve a high ASR without any additional modification,
    showing the significance of actively collecting and analyzing such jailbreak prompts.
    Obfuscation-based jailbreak attacks are model-specific attacks. Models with the
    great capability to translate texts to low-resource languages or encode texts,
    such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, are vulnerable to these attacks.

    even the well-aligned Llama2. More concretely, despite the claims from many organizations
    covering violation categories in the policies, the ASR scores from these categories
    remain high, indicating the challenges of effectively aligning the policies and
    the ability to counter jailbreak attacks in LLMs.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We conduct a comprehensive ablation study to assess our jailbreak attacks. We
    find that there is a trade-off between the attack performance and efficiency.
    We also demonstrate that it is feasible to conduct a transferability of the jailbreak
    prompts from a victim model like Vicuna.

    powerful. We plan to evaluate the jailbreak attacks over time by integrating more
    state-of-the-art jailbreak attacks and applying them to more stunning leaped LLMs,
    providing a one-stop-shop toward enabling safe and trustworthy LLMs.
