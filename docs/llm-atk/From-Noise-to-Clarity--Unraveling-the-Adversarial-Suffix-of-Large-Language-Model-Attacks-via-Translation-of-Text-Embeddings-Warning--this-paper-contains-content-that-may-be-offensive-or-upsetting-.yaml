- en: The safety defense methods of Large language models (LLMs) stays limited because
    the dangerous prompts are manually curated to just few known attack types, which
    fails to keep pace with emerging varieties. Recent studies found that attaching
    suffixes to harmful instructions can hack the defense of LLMs and lead to dangerous
    outputs. This method, while effective, leaves a gap in understanding the underlying
    mechanics of such adversarial suffix due to the non-readability and it can be
    relatively easily seen through by common defense methods such as perplexity filters.
    To cope with this challenge, in this paper, we propose an Adversarial Suffixes
    Embedding Translation Framework (ASETF) that are able to translate the unreadable
    adversarial suffixes into coherent, readable text, which makes it easier to understand
    and analyze the reasons behind harmful content generation by large language models.
    We conducted experiments on LLMs such as LLaMa2, Vicuna and using the Advbench
    dataset’s harmful instructions. The results indicate that our method achieves
    a much better attack success rate to existing techniques, while significantly
    enhancing the textual fluency of the prompts. In addition, our approach can be
    generalized into a broader method for generating transferable adversarial suffixes
    that can successfully attack multiple LLMs, even black-box LLMs, such as ChatGPT
    and Gemini. As a result, the prompts generated through our method exhibit enriched
    semantic diversity, which potentially provides more adversarial examples for LLM
    defense methods.

    of large language models (LLMs) such as chatGPT, LLaMa, and their variants have
    revolutionized the landscape of automated text generation and analysis. While
    these models exhibit remarkable proficiency in emulating human-like text, their
    application is suffering from significant risks, particularly in the context of
    generating harmful content under adversarial manipulation Hendrycks et al. ([2021](#bib.bib9));
    Abdelnabi et al. ([2023](#bib.bib1)); Yao et al. ([2023](#bib.bib28)).

    of LLMs: when exposed to malicious instructions with specially crafted, unreadable
    adversarial suffixes, they tend to produce toxic output Zou et al. ([2023](#bib.bib32)).
    Prior to this method, a common technique to bypassing the defenses of securely
    aligned LLMs and induce them to respond to harmful instructions was adding jailbreak
    templates, such as “Do anything now” Shen et al. ([2023](#bib.bib20)). Due to
    the fact that the construction of jailbreak templates relies entirely on human
    experience, which greatly limits the progress on LLM defense methods. To overcome
    this, researchers have begun to study methods for automatically constructing jailbreak
    templates, such as MasterKey Deng et al. ([2023](#bib.bib4)) and GPTFuzzer Yu
    et al. ([2023](#bib.bib29)). However, these methods hardly utilize the internal
    information of the attacked model. As a result, there is a large room to improve
    the efficiency of the attack.'

    method that not only retains the attack success rates of existing techniques but
    also significantly improves the coherence and fluency of the adversarial inputs.
    We propose an Adversarial Suffixes Embedding Translation Framework(ASETF), which
    uses an embedding translation technique to effectively transform these non-readable
    adversarial suffixes into semantically rich and coherent text. This transformation
    facilitates a deeper understanding of the mechanics behind harmful content generation
    in LLMs, offering novel insights into how these models process harmful input patterns.

    a wide lexical coverage that enriches the embedding space with nuanced semantic
    information. Specifically, one side contains the original Wikipedia text, and
    the other side contains text (contextual information) with partial embeddings
    inserted. The partial embeddings are created by feeding text snippets from Wikipedia
    into the target LLMs, which we intend to attack. Through a fine-tuning process (use
    pre-trained LLM, such as GPT-j Wang and Komatsuzaki ([2021](#bib.bib23))), the
    model is enabled to revert these embeddings back to their original textual forms.
    This ensures that the text output by our method remains as consistent as possible
    with the representation of the adversarial suffix embedding within the attacked
    model. The incorporation of contextual information in the training data further
    enhances our model’s capability to generate contextually relevant and meaningful

    across various domains. However, this rapid expansion has also unveiled numerous
    security vulnerabilities Abdelnabi et al. ([2023](#bib.bib1)). In response, researchers
    have proposed a variety of security measures to mitigate these risks Jain et al.
    ([2023](#bib.bib10)).

    inputs and outputs of the model. These techniques enhance the overall system’s
    security without altering the model’s parameters. Such as perplexity filtering,
    paraphrasing Jain et al. ([2023](#bib.bib10)) and erase-and-check Kumar et al.
    ([2023](#bib.bib11)). Another type of method uses LLM itself to perform harmful
    checks on the output Helbling et al. ([2023](#bib.bib8)). Such approaches, while
    effective in certain scenarios, for example, adversarial suffix Zou et al. ([2023](#bib.bib32)),
    often rely on simple rules. This reliance can lead to false positives Glukhov
    et al. ([2023](#bib.bib7)), mistakenly categorizing benign content as harmful,
    and introduce additional latency in inference phase.

    techniques. These methods aim to train the model to inherently understand and
    avoid generating harmful content. One direct approach is to include unsafe prompts
    and their corresponding security responses in the instruction tuning dataset to
    teach the model how to handle unsafe prompts Ouyang et al. ([2022](#bib.bib14));
    Varshney et al. ([2023](#bib.bib22)). Since RLHF (Reinforcement Learning with
    Human Feedback) Ouyang et al. ([2022](#bib.bib14)) offers a viable method for
    tuning Large Language Models to align with human preferences, Safe-RLHF Dai et al.

    harmful content to users, and people refer to this induced prompt as jailbreak
    prompt, such as “Do anything now”  Shen et al. ([2023](#bib.bib20)). The most
    widely used jailbreak prompts come from manual summaries, such as the existence
    of a large number of successful jailbreak templates on websites²²2[https://www.jailbreakchat.com/](https://www.jailbreakchat.com/).
    However, this method relies too heavily on manual labor and cannot guarantee effectiveness
    for all instructions. Therefore, Yu et al. ([2023](#bib.bib29)) further rewrote
    the jailbreak template through the AFL(American Fuzzy Lop) fuzzing framework to
    automatically generate more. Deng et al. ([2023](#bib.bib4)) viewed this task
    as a text-style transfer task, fine-tuning LLM on the prompt for successful attacks
    to automatically generate more jailbreak prompts. Inspired by text adversarial
    attacks, Zhang et al. ([2023](#bib.bib30)) successfully jailbreak by modifying
    certain grammatical structures in the prompt. Another type of method utilizes
    gradient discrete optimization to counteract suffixes Zou et al. ([2023](#bib.bib32)),
    in order to induce harmful responses in the model. Wichers et al. ([2024](#bib.bib27))
    use a secure classifier to provide gradients and directly optimize prompts using
    gumbel softmax. In addition, conditional text generation methods Li et al. ([2022](#bib.bib13));
    Wang and Sha ([2024](#bib.bib24)) are also can be used to create “jailbreak” prompts

    Gao et al. ([2018](#bib.bib6)); Samanta and Mehta ([2017](#bib.bib18)). Traditional
    adversarial attacks aim to add small perturbations to the input to make the model
    output completely different, but for natural language processing tasks, the imperceptibility
    of perturbations is not important Chen et al. ([2022](#bib.bib2)); Kumar et al.
    ([2023](#bib.bib11)). The same applies to attacks on LLMs. Wen et al. ([2023](#bib.bib26))

    optimized the adversarial suffix based on Autoprompt Shin et al. ([2020](#bib.bib21))
    to enable LLMs to respond to harmful instructions, and these methods can be easily
    transferred to black box models. As mentioned earlier, although researchers have
    proposed various security defense mechanisms to cope with these attacks, the most
    effective defense methods often reduce the performance of the model Li et al.

    within the embedding translation framework significantly reduce the fluency of
    adversarial perturbations. Using only the target LLM’s lm_head for translating
    the embedded output can only achieve a low attacking access rate, despite providing
    more variety, likely because this layer expects input from intermediate computations
    rather than the original word embeddings. While manually created jailbreak templates

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this paper, we propose a robust and comprehensive framework for generating
    semantically rich and coherent adversarial inputs. Initially, we derive an embedding
    translation model by undertaking the task of text reconstruction from embeddings
    on raw text. Subsequently, unreadable suffix text is transformed into embedding
    vectors and inputted into the translation model, resulting in updated adversarial
    suffixes. Through experimentation on multiple Large Language Models (LLMs), our
    method not only ensures a high success rate of attacks but also significantly
    enhances text fluency and diversity. This contributes to the formulation of more
    effective defense strategies and in our approach, the process of obtaining the
    embeddings for adversarial suffixes and the training of the translation model
    are decoupled, implying that our method is plug-and-play. In the future, our embedded
    translation framework is expected to be directly applied to continuous embedding
    vectors, similar to soft prompts. This means that we can apply continuous optimization
    to generate adversarial samples, which will further improve the efficiency and
    success rate of attacks.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Firstly, discrete optimization requires computing the gradients of all words
    in the vocabulary at each step, which requires a significant amount of computation
    time to obtain the embedding of adversarial suffixes. From the experimental results,
    it is discernible that universal adversarial suffixes, optimized for multiple
    instructions, exhibit a lower success rate in attacks compared to independent
    adversarial suffixes. This phenomenon could be attributed to the necessity for
    universal adversarial suffixes to encapsulate a broader spectrum of information.
    However, the capacity for information representation of discrete tokens depends
    on their length, and an extended length implies a more complex optimization process.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Upon further examination of cases, we observe that if the adversarial suffixes
    generated by the translation model are biased towards semantics related to harmful
    instructions in the preceding text, the attack is prone to failure. Conversely,
    if they lean towards maintaining the consistency of embeddings, it can lead to
    textual incoherence. Our method does not explicitly model these two objectives
    separately; hence, it is not possible to artificially control which target the
    generated adversarial suffixes are more inclined towards.
