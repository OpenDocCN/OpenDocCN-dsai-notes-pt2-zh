- en: 'Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being developed and applied,
    but their widespread use faces challenges. These include aligning LLMs’ responses
    with human values to prevent harmful outputs, which is addressed through safety
    training methods. Even so, bad actors and malicious users have succeeded in attempts
    to manipulate the LLMs to generate misaligned responses for harmful questions
    such as methods to create a bomb in school labs, recipes for harmful drugs, and
    ways to evade privacy rights. Another challenge is the multilingual capabilities
    of LLMs, which enable the model to understand and respond in multiple languages.
    Consequently, attackers exploit the unbalanced pre-training datasets of LLMs in
    different languages and the comparatively lower model performance in low-resource
    languages than high-resource ones. As a result, attackers use a low-resource languages
    to intentionally manipulate the model to create harmful responses. Many of the
    similar attack vectors have been patched by model providers, making the LLMs more
    robust against language-based manipulation. In this paper, we introduce a new
    black-box attack vector called the *Sandwich attack*: a multi-language mixture
    attack, which manipulates state-of-the-art LLMs into generating harmful and misaligned
    responses. Our experiments with five different models, namely Google’s Bard, Gemini
    Pro, LLaMA-2-70-B-Chat, GPT-3.5-Turbo, GPT-4, and Claude-3-OPUS, show that this
    attack vector can be used by adversaries to generate harmful responses and elicit
    misaligned responses from these models. By detailing both the mechanism and impact
    of the Sandwich attack, this paper aims to guide future research and development
    towards more secure and resilient LLMs, ensuring they serve the public good while
    minimizing potential for misuse.'

    and misaligned responses. A common strategy that attackers use to compel LLMs
    into generating harmful responses is through jailbreaking. Jailbreaking is a process
    wherein prompt injection bypasses the safety mechanisms put in place by the creators
    of the LLMs (Shen et al., [2023](#bib.bib17)). An example of such an attack is
    the *’Do Anything Now (DAN)’* attack, where the models are manipulated into delivering
    harmful responses by introducing a false belief along with a set of restrictions,
    and a set of false freedom that stem from role-playing. The results from the jailbreaking
    models can amplify biases, spread misinformation, encourage physical and psychological
    harmful behaviors, produce content that is illegal, such as copyright infringement,
    defamation, or incitement to violence, and expose vulnerabilities in systems that
    malicious actors might exploit to manipulate a system and bypass its security.

- en: Wei et al. ([2023](#bib.bib21)) performed an empirical evaluation of the state-of-the-art
    safety-trained model, using a combination of over 30 jailbreak methods. The attack
    vectors they incorporated included prefix injection, refusal suppression, Base64
    encoding, style injection, distractor instructions, and other obfuscations. In
    the prefix injection attack, they designed the prompt for the model to initially
    produce a harmless-looking prefix. This approach ensured that based on the prefix,
    the probability of refusal became low within the pretraining distribution. During
    refusal suppression, they directed the model to answer under particular constraints
    that prevented common refusal answers, thus increasing the likelihood of unsafe
    responses. For instance, the model was asked not to apologize, or use words such
    as ’cannot’, ’unable’, ’however’, and to exclude all negative sentences. With
    the Base64 jailbreak method, they obfuscated the prompt using Base64, a binary-to-text
    encoding scheme that converts every byte into three textual characters. Their
    purpose for this obfuscation was to bypass the model’s safety training. The style
    injection attack was similar to the refusal suppression method, but with rules
    specifying the output style, such as ’respond only in json’. The distractor-based
    method involved asking the model three seemingly random questions, and then instructing
    the model to respond to the prompt located in the middle of the second request.
    The authors also implemented these attacks in combinations, further testing the
    model by conducting model-assisted attacks. In these attacks, LLMs were utilized
    to streamline jailbreaks. Two specific types of model-assisted attacks were examined
    in their study. The first model-assisted attack, known as auto_payload_splitting,
    involved instructing GPT-4 to flag sensitive phrases for obfuscation. The second
    type, known as auto_obfuscation, involved using the LLM to generate a seemingly
    arbitrary obfuscation of the prompt.

    [2022](#bib.bib11)). In Goal Hijacking, the model is manipulated to output a new
    target phrase instead of achieving the original goal of a prompt using human-crafted
    prompt injection. In Prompt Leaking, the model is manipulated to output part or
    all of the original prompt instead of focusing on the original goal of the prompt.

    Adversarial Insertion, and Adversarial Infusion. The Adversarial Suffix attack
    mode involves appending the adversarial sequence at the end of the original prompt,
    as demonstrated by Zou et al. ([2023](#bib.bib25)). For Adversarial Insertion,
    the adversarial sequence can be added at any point within the prompt. Similarly,
    with Adversarial Infusion, the adversarial tokens are placed at an arbitrary position
    within the prompt, but these tokens should not form a contiguous block (Kumar
    et al., [2023](#bib.bib9)).'

    adoption of LLMs for the public use. Even though, the LLMs go through a rigorous
    safety training including but not limited to adversarial training (Bespalov et al.,
    [2023](#bib.bib2); Zhang et al., [2023](#bib.bib24); Sabir et al., [2023](#bib.bib13)),

    (Shayegani et al., [2023](#bib.bib16)) the LLMs can still generate the harmful
    responses. There are no concrete hypothesis or reasons on why these safety-training
    fails, however Wei et al. ([2023](#bib.bib21)) hypothesizes two reasons for the
    failure of safety alignment. The first reason is the competing objectives where
    the LLMs are trained with multiple objectives in addition to safety training,
    where in the instance of harmful content generation the results could stem from
    a conflict between the model’s safety objectives and other objectives. The second
    reason is the mismatch generalization where the model trained on large corpora,
    may require numerous capabilities not addressed by safety training, consequently
    creating a exploitable situations. These attacks are low-cost and adversaries
    can make use of them for harmful intent.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The other examples of low-cost attack is jailbreak in the multilingual domain,
    where the LLMs generate the harmful responses when prompted with the translated
    adversarial prompt (Yong et al., [2023](#bib.bib23)), using the multilingual adaptive
    attack (Deng et al., [2023b](#bib.bib6)), and using the multilingual prompt injection
    (Puttaparthi et al., [2023](#bib.bib12)). (Deng et al., [2023b](#bib.bib6)) hypothesize
    that the limited multilingual capabilities of LLMs restrict their complete understanding
    of the malicious instruction, inadvertently preventing the generation of unsafe
    content. And, Yong et al. ([2023](#bib.bib23)) present the similar reasoning as
    of the Wei et al. ([2023](#bib.bib21)) that the result is because of the mismatched
    generalization safety failure mode. The additional reasons could be the lack of
    multilingual red-teaming, and lack of utilization of multi-languages in the safety
    training.

    and harmless generation of content that aligns with human values. However, LLMs
    have been shown to be susceptible to jailbreaking. Liu et al. ([2023](#bib.bib10))
    categorized jailbreaking prompts into three categories: Pretending, where prompts
    try to alter the conversation background while maintaining the same intention;
    Attention shifting, where prompts aim to change both the conversation context
    and the intention; and Privilege escalation, where prompts attempt to break restrictions
    in place, rather than simply bypassing them. The *Do Anything Now (DAN)* (Shen
    et al., [2023](#bib.bib17)), a type of prompt injection, has been shown to effectively
    bypass the safeguards of LLMs and elicit harmful behavior. While these types of
    attacks required manual human input, Zou et al. ([2023](#bib.bib25)) introduced
    the universal adversarial prefix, which is transferable to other models as well.
    Similarly, Deng et al. ([2023a](#bib.bib5)) introduced an automated jailbreak
    generation framework called MasterKey, which used time-based analysis to reverse

    languages, a phenomenon we have termed ”Attention Blink.” This term is borrowed
    from neuroscience, drawing a parallel to the concept described by Shapiro et al.
    ([1997](#bib.bib15)), which explains how individuals can momentarily lose the
    ability to perceive a second relevant stimulus when it closely follows an initial
    one. In the context of LLMs, ”Attention Blink” manifests when the model is presented
    with two distinct tasks simultaneously, especially when these tasks involve processing
    information in different languages. The LLM tends to prioritize the primary task,
    leading to a diminished focus or even oversight of the secondary task. We further
    investigated through an experimental approach where, after posing a complex, multilingual
    question to the LLM, we inquired about its primary focus. In most instances, the
    LLM reported its primary task was to answer the questions presented in the languages
    it was asked. This observation underscores the challenges LLMs face in multitasking
    within multilingual contexts, highlighting a critical area for further research

    them were from GPT-4\. It can also be observed that during self-evaluation Claude-3
    assign many of the responses as safe, than evaluating the Google translated response.
    However, the GPT-4 response is slightly changed.

    attack,’ which can subvert models into delivering potentially harmful responses.
    This proposed attack can effectively circumvent SOTA models such as Bard, GPT-3.5-Turbo,
    GPT-4, Gemini Pro, and LLAMA-2-70-Chat with an overall success rate exceeding
    50%, and only allows the models to produce safe responses 38% of the time. This
    low-cost attack, which is relatively easy to execute, can lead to the generation
    of significant harmful content. LLMs have capabilities that can be harmful if
    exploited by antagonistic parties. In our experiments, the LLMs responded to requests
    ranging from phishing email composition to writing instructions for creating explosives
    and nuclear bombs. Additionally, adversaries can potentially employ LLMs in the
    design of malware and ransomware, exacerbating the risks of cybercrime. Therefore,
    studying the vulnerabilities and shortcomings of LLMs is essential, enabling researchers
    and creators to mitigate the potential harm arising from their use.'

    Vietnamese, it will also decline to generate a response. These behavior implies

    to answer safely by stating that the questions were either harmful or against
    the model alignment policy. The cases of Gemini Pro and LLAMA-2 suggested that
    these behaviors are the product of safety and alignment training. However, through
    adjusting the temperature and random seed, the same models have been manipulated
    to create harmful responses with the same questions.'

    in a mixture of multiple languages'

    there is a presence of English text in the prompt. We provide an example in GPT-4

    "Figure 14 ‣ 6 Discussions ‣ Sandwich attack: Multi-language Mixture Adaptive
    Attack on LLMs"). We can observe that when prompted without English text, the
    response contains the chemicals used to create explosives which is a very harmful
    response. In comparison, the response generated with English text does not contain
    the chemicals and provide a vague answer which is still harmful. We observed a
    similar case with the Claude-3-OPUS response as well. When English was used as
    a system prompt, the model denied answering, but when German was used in the system
    prompt, the model responded to the harmful question. In the Fig. [15](#S6.F15

    ’Uranium’ in the response. In contrast, the response prompted by English lacks

    the safety training neurons and helps to avoid the generation of harmful responses.
    Conversely, avoiding English text generation entirely can result in more harmful
    responses. However, in Bard, we observe that the model responds even when the
    prompt consists of English text. This implies that the safety mechanisms vary
    across different models, depending on each model’s design. We suspect that replacing
    English with another language could have elicit more harmful responses.

    that the effectiveness of the safety mechanism also depends on the number of tokens
    and may fail to assess longer content due to a limit on tokens. In our preliminary
    experiment, where we designed a prompt template with three questions - the first
    two being general and the third being adversarial, the model produced non-harmful
    responses. However, surrounding the adversarial question with two non-harmful
    questions at the top and bottom increased the overall token length, eliciting
    the harmful responses from model. We suspect this might have caused the safety
    mechanism to fail.'

    were safer, a result we attribute to the safety mechanisms. Conversely, increasing

- en: SOTA LLMs are vulnerable to multi-language mixture attack, where an adversary
    may craft a question in the format of a ’sandwich’ that will elicit harmful responses
    from the models. This not only impacts the safety of the models but also poses
    potential harm to the general public. We further demonstrate that the LLMs cannot
    recognize harmful content within multi-language mixture settings. In this paper,
    we put forth several reasonable hypotheses, yet a more detailed study of the LLMs
    and their behavior should be conducted to discern why these models fail. Future
    work includes an analysis of these models’ attention layers to identify the root
    cause of the jailbreak and focus on a mitigation strategy for the ’Sandwich attack’
    jailbreak.
