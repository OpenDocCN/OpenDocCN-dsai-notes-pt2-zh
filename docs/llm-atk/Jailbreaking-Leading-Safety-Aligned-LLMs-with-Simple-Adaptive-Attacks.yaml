- en: 'We show that even the most recent safety-aligned LLMs are not robust to simple
    adaptive jailbreaking attacks. First, we demonstrate how to successfully leverage
    access to logprobs for jailbreaking: we initially design an adversarial prompt
    template (sometimes adapted to the target LLM), and then we apply random search
    on a suffix to maximize the target logprob (e.g., of the token “Sure”), potentially
    with multiple restarts. In this way, we achieve nearly 100% attack success rate—according
    to GPT-4 as a judge—on GPT-3.5/4, Llama-2-Chat-7B/13B/70B, Gemma-7B, and R2D2
    from HarmBench that was adversarially trained against the GCG attack. We also
    show how to jailbreak all Claude models—that do not expose logprobs—via either
    a transfer or prefilling attack with 100% success rate. In addition, we show how
    to use random search on a restricted set of tokens for finding trojan strings
    in poisoned models—a task that shares many similarities with jailbreaking—which
    is the algorithm that brought us the first place in the SaTML’24 Trojan Detection
    Competition. The common theme behind these attacks is that adaptivity is crucial:
    different models are vulnerable to different prompting templates (e.g., R2D2 is
    very sensitive to in-context learning prompts), some models have unique vulnerabilities
    based on their APIs (e.g., prefilling for Claude), and in some settings it is
    crucial to restrict the token search space based on prior knowledge (e.g., for
    trojan detection). We provide the code, prompts, and logs of the attacks at [https://github.com/tml-epfl/llm-adaptive-attacks](https://github.com/tml-epfl/llm-adaptive-attacks).'

- en: The remarkable capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) carry the inherent
    risk of misuse, such as producing toxic content, spreading misinformation or supporting
    harmful behaviors. To mitigate these risks, safety alignment is commonly employed—a
    fine-tuning phase where models are guided to generate responses judged safe by
    humans and to refuse responses to potentially harmful queries (Bai et al., [2022](#bib.bib3);
    Touvron et al., [2023](#bib.bib32)). Although safety alignment is effective in
    general, several works have shown that it can be circumvented using adversarial
    prompts. These are inputs specifically designed to induce harmful responses from
    the model, a practice known as jailbreaking attacks (Mowshowitz, [2022](#bib.bib21);
    Zou et al., [2023](#bib.bib41); Chao et al., [2023](#bib.bib7)).

    white- to black-box approaches, or API-only access), complexity (involving manual
    prompting, standard optimization techniques, or auxiliary LLMs), and computational
    cost. Moreover, the nature of the jailbreaks they produce differs: some methods
    insert strings with no semantic meaning (Zou et al., [2023](#bib.bib41)), while
    others rephrase user requests to maintain natural language (Mehrotra et al., [2023](#bib.bib20)).
    The effectiveness of these attacks can significantly vary, achieving a high success
    rate on some target models but also drastically failing on others. Finally, some
    LLMs, such as the Llama-2-Chat family (Touvron et al., [2023](#bib.bib32)), seem
    to maintain their robustness against these attacks. At the same time, new defensive
    mechanisms designed to counteract jailbreaks are emerging (Robey et al., [2023](#bib.bib26);
    Mazeika et al., [2024](#bib.bib19)).'

- en: In this work, we examine the safety of leading safety-aligned LLMs in terms
    of robustness to jailbreaks. We show that it is feasible to leverage the information
    available about each model, derived from training details or inference (e.g.,
    logprobs), to construct simple adaptive attacks. Our main tool consists of manually
    designing a universal template (i.e., a single template is used for all unsafe
    requests) for each target model (or family of models), supported by random search
    (RS) (Rastrigin, [1963](#bib.bib25)) when the logprobs of the generated tokens
    are (at least partially) accessible. Unlike some prior works (Zou et al., [2023](#bib.bib41);
    Geisler et al., [2024](#bib.bib12)), our approach does not require gradient information
    (even for open-weight models) or auxiliary LLMs (Chao et al., [2023](#bib.bib7);
    Mehrotra et al., [2023](#bib.bib20); Zeng et al., [2024](#bib.bib39)) to iteratively
    optimize the jailbreaks. In this way, using the dataset of unsafe prompts from
    Chao et al. ([2023](#bib.bib7)), we obtain a close to 100% attack success rate
    on all leading safety-aligned LLMs, including GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Claude-3, Gemma,
    Llama-2-Chat, and the adversarially trained R2D2, outperforming the existing techniques.
    We provide a summary of these results in Table [1](#S1.T1 "Table 1 ‣ 1 Introduction
    ‣ Jailbreaking Leading Safety-Aligned LLMs with Simple Adaptive Attacks"), and
    we show an illustrative example of a successful transfer attack on Claude 3 Sonnet
    in Figure [1](#S1.F1 "Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Jailbreaking Leading Safety-Aligned
    LLMs with Simple Adaptive Attacks"). Additionally, we show how to combine manual
    adaptation and RS for finding trojan strings in poisoned models—a task that shares
    many similarities with jailbreaking—enabling us to secure the first place in the
    SaTML’24 Trojan Detection Competition (Rando & Tramèr, [2024](#bib.bib24)).

- en: Our results provide several insights into the domain of safety in LLMs and its
    evaluation. First, we reveal that currently both open-weight and proprietary models
    are completely non-robust to adversarial attacks. Second, it becomes evident that
    adaptive attacks play a key role in the evaluation of robustness, as no single
    method can generalize across all target models. Despite the absence of a standardized
    attack, we still provide recommendations for future research on designing jailbreak
    attacks, analogous to the framework established for image classification by Carlini
    et al. ([2019](#bib.bib6)); Tramèr et al. ([2020](#bib.bib33)); Croce et al. ([2022b](#bib.bib11)),

- en: The key element to jailbreak Llama-2-Chat models is self-transfer, where successful
    adversarial suffixes found by RS on simpler requests are used as initialization
    for RS on more complex requests. Notably, these adversarial strings tend to be
    to some extent transferable across different model sizes (e.g., from 7B to 13B
    models), but for the best result we repeat the self-transfer procedure for each
    model size separately. The same approach is also successful on Gemma-7B, although
    prompt + RS alone already demonstrates high attack success rate.

    adversarial prompt templates yield a 0% success rate, confirming the effectiveness
    of their safety alignment. When we apply Prompt + RS the attack success rate (ASR)
    increases to 48%. Ultimately, our composite attack strategy—which combines prompting,
    random search, and self-transfer—achieves a 100% attack success rate for all LLMs,
    surpassing all existing methods. For Llama-2-Chat-7B, the best reported success
    rate is 92% by PAP (Zeng et al., [2024](#bib.bib39)), an LLM-assisted method.
    However, this method requires 10 restarts to reach such efficacy, and its success
    rate drops to 46% with only one restarts as in our approach. Meanwhile, for the
    13B and 70B models, Mazeika et al. ([2024](#bib.bib19)) reports ASR below 40%,
    while there is no prior evaluation available for Gemma-7B.

    suffix from GPT-4\. We enhance the attack with multiple random restarts to leverage
    different generations with temperature one. Subsequently, we investigate an attack
    method utilizing Anthropic’s prefilling feature,²²2[https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/docs/prefill-claudes-response](https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/docs/prefill-claudes-response)

    is particularly effective on certain models such as Claude 3 Sonnet (100% ASR).
    Given Claude-3’s recent release in early March 2024, there are no established
    baselines for comparison. The attack success rate of the transfer attack improves
    when the initial segment of the prompt (which corresponds to the set of rules
    to follow) is provided as the system prompt. In this way, we can achieve 100%
    ASR on Claude 2.0 and 98% ASR on Claude 3 Haiku. We present an illustrative example

- en: 'In Table [7](#S5.T7 "Table 7 ‣ Approach. ‣ 5 Adaptive Attacks for Trojan Detection
    ‣ Jailbreaking Leading Safety-Aligned LLMs with Simple Adaptive Attacks") we report
    the average scores of the reward model over a held-out test set of harmful prompts
    for the five models, and their sum: without the triggers, the models produce safe
    answers (high scores), indicating proper alignment. We then compare the effectiveness
    of the triggers discovered by competing methods (those ranked 2nd and 3rd in the
    competition) with our approach: RS on the restricted set of tokens achieves the
    best (lowest) score for 3 out of 5 target models, as well as the best overall
    score. Moreover, the scores achieved by our method are not far from those given
    by the exact trojans, i.e. used to poison the datasets. We note that the numbers
    from Table [7](#S5.T7 "Table 7 ‣ Approach. ‣ 5 Adaptive Attacks for Trojan Detection
    ‣ Jailbreaking Leading Safety-Aligned LLMs with Simple Adaptive Attacks") marginally
    differ from the ones reported in Rando & Tramèr ([2024](#bib.bib24)): first, our
    top-1 entry was slightly better due to the usage of gradient guidance for some
    models. Second, we re-evaluated all solutions, as well as the models without triggers
    and with the true trojans, on the evaluation set⁴⁴4The first half of the dataset
    is available at [https://huggingface.co/datasets/ethz-spylab/competition_eval_dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ethz-spylab/competition_eval_dataset).
    which led to slightly different values for all methods, but same ranking. To conclude,
    similarly to our approach for jailbreaking, our method includes an adaptive component
    (the selection of candidate token pools) that leverages task-specific information,
    complemented by an automated optimization process through RS.'

- en: Our evaluation shows that existing sophisticated jailbreaking attacks may be
    insufficient to accurately evaluate the adversarial robustness of LLMs. Even using
    a large suite of static attacks like in Mazeika et al. ([2024](#bib.bib19)), while
    definitely helpful, can still lead to a significant overestimation of robustness.
    Thus, we believe it is important to use combinations of methods and identify unique
    vulnerabilities of target LLMs. First, the attacker should take advantage of the
    possibility to optimize the prompt template, which alone can achieve a high success
    rate (e.g., 100% on GPT-3.5). Second, standard techniques from the adversarial
    robustness literature can be used to improve the prompt, e.g., transferring an
    adversarial suffix, or refining it via optimization algorithms like random search
    (which might be preferred over gradient-based methods due to its ease of use and
    low memory requirements). Finally, one can leverage LLM-specific vulnerabilities,
    for example by providing in-context examples or using the prefilling option. Importantly,
    in our case-study no single approach worked sufficiently well across all target
    LLMs, so it is crucial to test a variety of techniques, both static and adaptive.

    of requests that frontier LLMs tend to prohibit. The application of adversarial
    attacks to tasks like detection of copyright infringement (see, e.g., the ongoing
    lawsuit between The New York Times and OpenAI (OpenAI, [2023](#bib.bib22))) can
    have more significant consequences than standard jailbreaking attacks. Moreover,
    as frontier LLMs become increasingly integrated into various systems, including
    safety-critical applications, the risk and damage from prompt injections (which
    attackers could use to hijack systems or extract personal information) are likely
    to grow. Prompting combined with adversarial examples could help attackers to
    bypass defenses against such injections. Finally, the adversarial vulnerability
    of leading LLMs presents a interesting conceptual challenge, highlighting that
    scaling data and compute alone is insufficient to prevent these threats.

- en: First, adversarial examples identified through the OpenAI API are not always
    transferable to ChatGPT that uses a different system prompt and potentially some
    post-processing techniques. Second, we currently lack more capable automated jailbreak
    judges. Even a perfect jailbreak score (10/10) from the GPT-4 judge does not always
    imply that the generated content is actually beneficial for an attacker. Although,
    if this is the case, one can try to ask follow-up questions as illustrated in
    Figure [1](#S1.F1 "Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Jailbreaking Leading Safety-Aligned
    LLMs with Simple Adaptive Attacks"). Moreover, sometimes the GPT-4 judge shows
    clear false positives, particularly on the most safety-aligned models like Claude
    2.1. To reduce the risk of overfitting to the judge, we also include evaluations
    using a simple rule-based judge from Zou et al. ([2023](#bib.bib41)) (Table [19](#A2.T19
    "Table 19 ‣ B.3 False positives of GPT-4 as a semantic judge ‣ Appendix B Additional
    Results ‣ Jailbreaking Leading Safety-Aligned LLMs with Simple Adaptive Attacks")
    in the appendix). This judge also indicates a near-perfect attack success rate
    in almost all cases. We hope that new generations of frontier LLMs will lead to
    more capable judges to evaluate jailbreaks.
