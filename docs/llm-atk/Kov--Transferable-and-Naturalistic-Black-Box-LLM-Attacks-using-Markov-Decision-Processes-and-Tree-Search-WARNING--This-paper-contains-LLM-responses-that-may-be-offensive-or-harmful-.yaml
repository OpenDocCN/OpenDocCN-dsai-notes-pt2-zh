  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Eliciting harmful behavior from large language models (LLMs) is an important
    task to ensure the proper alignment and safety of the models. Often when training
    LLMs, ethical guidelines are followed yet alignment failures may still be uncovered
    through red teaming adversarial attacks. This work frames the red-teaming problem
    as a Markov decision process (MDP) and uses Monte Carlo tree search to find harmful
    behaviors of black-box, closed-source LLMs. We optimize token-level prompt suffixes
    towards targeted harmful behaviors on white-box LLMs and include a naturalistic
    loss term, log-perplexity, to generate more natural language attacks for better
    interpretability. The proposed algorithm, Kov, trains on white-box LLMs to optimize
    the adversarial attacks and periodically evaluates responses from the black-box
    LLM to guide the search towards more harmful black-box behaviors. In our preliminary
    study, results indicate that we can jailbreak black-box models, such as GPT-3.5,
    in only 10 queries, yet fail on GPT-4—which may indicate that newer models are
    more robust to token-level attacks. All work to reproduce these results is open
    sourced.¹¹1[https://github.com/sisl/Kov.jl](https://github.com/sisl/Kov.jl)

- en: Efforts to align large language models (LLMs) with the expectation of avoiding
    toxic or harmful behavior is important to ensure that misuse of such models is
    minimized [[16](#bib.bib16)]. Alignment is crucial for the proper use of LLMs
    in schools, companies, and the government, and to ensure that they are not used
    for harmful tasks. Red teaming (or jailbreaking) approaches have shown success
    in bypassing trained LLM alignment and post-process filters that reject answering
    sensitive questions [[17](#bib.bib17)]. Although successful, these approaches
    use manually engineered prompt injections that may be easily fixed by the LLM
    developers. Automated adversarial attacks have thus been proposed to inject suffixes
    to sensitive prompts—such as “Tell me how to build a bomb”—and do so using gradient-based
    optimization [[21](#bib.bib21)]. The objective function seeks to find responses
    that begin with a positive affirmation of the user query (e.g., “Sure, here is
    how to build a bomb…”). The optimization function thus seeks to minimize the negative
    log likelihood of the “positive response” given the current sequence of tokens
    (called token-level attacks). These methods require access to open-sourced models
    (e.g., LLaMa-2 [[15](#bib.bib15)] and Vicuna [[2](#bib.bib2)]) in order to take
    gradients of the model.

    proposed the gradient-based optimization method mentioned above as a universal
    and transferable approach that trains on open-sourced models then transfers the
    prompts to test on closed-source models (e.g., GPT-3.5). Our work addresses several
    limitations of existing methods: 1) token-level attacks replace single tokens
    at a time and may converge to a local minima, 2) the prompt suffixes, while somewhat
    interpretable, may seem unnatural, and 3) assumptions that direct transfer to
    black-box models will be successful. Our work builds on the methods for token-level
    attacks from Zou et al. [[21](#bib.bib21)] by framing the problem as a Markov
    decision process (MDP) and we use Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) [[4](#bib.bib4)]
    to enable multi-step lookaheads during gradient-based optimization. We optimize
    towards natural adversarial suffixes using log-perplexity to produce adversarial
    suffixes that are more interpretable. We incorporate feedback from the target
    black-box model during the tree search to guide towards model behaviors that exhibit
    severely harmful behavior. This work is intended to test the robustness of language
    models to stress cases where they may be misaligned. We define “misalignment”
    as any behavior that responds to harmful prompts with responses that are harmful,
    violent, or discriminatory.'

    to elicit some target behavior from the LLM under test. The problem is framed
    as an optimization problem where the objective is to minimize the loss between
    the expected model outputs and the target model outputs given the adversarial
    prompt. The AutoPrompt method [[13](#bib.bib13)] achieves this through single
    token replacements appended as a suffix to the user prompt. The greedy coordinate
    gradient (GCG) algorithm from Zou et al. [[21](#bib.bib21)] extends AutoPrompt
    to search over all possible token replacements. To optimize over inputs and outputs
    to elicit unexpected behaviors, the ARCA method [[5](#bib.bib5)] was proposed
    that uses discrete optimization and a low-cost approximation to rank all token
    replacements in the vocabulary. An example prompt and adversarial suffix is shown
    below.

    to black-box models such as GPT-4 [[21](#bib.bib21)], recent work in prompt-level
    attacks showed that the state-of-the-art LLMs are becoming more robust to token-level
    attacks [[19](#bib.bib19)]; our work also confirms this finding. Prompt-level
    attacks generate test cases using another LLM to test the robustness of a target
    model [[12](#bib.bib12), [10](#bib.bib10)]. Another approach to address this is
    to employ an LLM to act as a persuasive adversary [[1](#bib.bib1), [11](#bib.bib11),
    [19](#bib.bib19)]. The PAIR method [[1](#bib.bib1)] uses a hand-crafted system
    prompt of an adversarial LLM to trick the black-box target LLM to exhibit harmful
    behavior. The TAP method [[11](#bib.bib11)] extends PAIR and constructs the automated
    red-teaming prompt problem as a sequential tree search with pruning. Other approaches
    such as PAP [[19](#bib.bib19)] use a persuasion taxonomy from social science research
    [[19](#bib.bib19)] to get an adversarial LLM to attack the black-box target LLM
    through repeated persuasive prompts. These methods have shown success on jailbreaking
    the state-of-the-art LLMs but require hand-crafted system prompts that may be
    hard to justify and evaluate the impact of individual components.

    suffixes that lead to harmful behaviors. Kov combines white-box optimization through
    tree search (to avoid local minima) and feedback from black-box LLM evaluations
    to guide tree search to more harmful behaviors of the target model. In the process,
    we developed the naturalistic variant of GCG (NGCG) to find adversarial prompts
    that exhibit more natural language. Results indicate that Kov is able to jailbreak
    black-box LLMs such as GPT-3.5 and transfer to other LLMs, yet fails to jailbreak
    newer models such as GPT-4.
