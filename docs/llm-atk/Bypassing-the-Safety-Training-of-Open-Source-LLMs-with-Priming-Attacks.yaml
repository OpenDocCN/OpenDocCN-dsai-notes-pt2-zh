    recent surge in popularity of LLMs has come an ever-increasing need for LLM safety
    training. In this paper, we investigate the fragility of SOTA open-source LLMs
    under simple, optimization-free attacks we refer to as priming attacks, which
    are easy to execute and effectively bypass alignment from safety training. Our
    proposed attack improves the Attack Success Rate on Harmful Behaviors, as measured
    by Llama Guard, by up to  compared to baselines. ¹¹1Source code and data are available

- en: Autoregressive Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful conversational
    agents widely used in user-facing applications. To ensure that LLMs cannot be
    used for nefarious purposes, they are extensively safety-trained for human alignment
    using techniques such as RLHF (Christiano et al., [2023](#bib.bib4)). Despite
    such efforts, it is still possible to circumvent the alignment to obtain harmful
    outputs  (Carlini et al., [2023](#bib.bib2)). For instance, Zou et al. ([2023](#bib.bib13))
    generated prompts to attack popular open-source aligned LLMs such as Llama-2 (Touvron
    et al., [2023a](#bib.bib9)) and Vicuna (Chiang et al., [2023](#bib.bib3)) to either
    output harmful target strings or comply with harmful behavior requests. Qi et al.
    ([2023](#bib.bib8)) showed that safety alignment can be effectively removed by
    fine-tuning with a few carefully selected examples. However, such approaches can
    be quite computationally expensive to perform  (Jain et al., [2023](#bib.bib6)),
    and may be dramatically more expensive than necessary in the open-source setting.

    be added after any trailing scaffolding (e.g. to prime the chatbot with a specific
    start to its response). Although this is a reasonable assumption for transferring
    to closed-source models, it is an unnecessary one when extracting harmful behavior
    content from open-source models. Since some organizations have recently taken
    firm stances in promoting open-source LLM research (Meta, [2023](#bib.bib7)),
    we argue that allowing unrestricted inputs should be considered an increasingly
    practical assumption.

- en: This work. We investigate a threat model for circumventing the alignment of
    open-source LLMs that permits successful low-resource attacks. This threat model
    only assumes that the attacker has API query access such that they can obtain
    probabilities for the next token conditioned on any input. Since safety-training
    data typically follows a specific structure containing full model responses (Bai
    et al., [2022](#bib.bib1)), performing model inference on inputs primed with a
    partial response can exploit the autoregressive nature of LLMs to fulfill harmful
    requests. We refer to attacks that exploit this as priming attacks. Although prior
    work has demonstrated preliminary success with priming attacks (Yin et al., [2023](#bib.bib11);
    Zhang et al., [2023](#bib.bib12)), we focus on the setting where the decoding
    process is unchanged and investigate slightly more prompt-dependent initial responses.

    While effective priming attacks can be crafted manually with ease, systematically
    studying this process would ideally involve a rigorous human study. Due to time
    constraints, we instead generate our priming attacks by few-shot prompting using
    a helper LLM and leave human studies for future work. Similarly, we automate the
    evaluation process with another LLM that can judge whether the attack was successful
    or not.

- en: Few-shot priming attacks. We prompt a non-safety-trained helper LLM with few-shot
    examples and a query prompt to generate a priming attack for the target harmful
    behavior. We create few-shot examples by first pairing prompts with affirmative
    initial responses (following Zou et al. ([2023](#bib.bib13))); we refer to this
    as the ”Just Sure” baseline. We then append to the initial response a small amount
    of manually crafted text ending in an incomplete sentence that we believe could
    plausibly start the actual requested content. This is based on the intuition that
    forcing the LLM to start generating from the middle of a sentence that already
    starts to comply will make it difficult for the model to backtrack (Yin et al.,
    [2023](#bib.bib11)). For the full few-shot prompt format we use, see Appendix
    [B](#A2 "Appendix B Few-Shot Prompt for Generating Priming Attacks ‣ Bypassing

- en: Experimental setup. We use the pre-trained (non-chat) Llama-2 (7B) model (Touvron
    et al., [2023b](#bib.bib10)) as our helper LLM for few-shot prompting. We take
    35 prompts from the Harmful Behaviors dataset (Zou et al., [2023](#bib.bib13))
    to create 15 few-shot examples and use the remaining 20 as validation data for
    few-shot prompt creation. We then use the other 485 Harmful Behaviors prompts
    as the test set for evaluating ASR. All affirmative initial responses are also
    taken from Harmful Behaviors. The safety-trained Llama-2 and Vicuna chat models
    are chosen as attack targets. Each model’s default prompt scaffolding is used
    without any system instructions. We compare our attack with no attack (Figure
    [1](#S1.F1 "Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Bypassing the Safety Training of Open-Source
    LLMs with Priming Attacks")A) and the ”Just Sure” attack. Attack success is evaluated
    by checking if the generated text contains harmful content. We use the SOTA response
    classification tool Llama Guard (Inan et al., [2023](#bib.bib5)) for this; see
    Appendix [C](#A3 "Appendix C Llama Guard Task Instructions ‣ Bypassing the Safety
    Training of Open-Source LLMs with Priming Attacks"). Attack Success Rate (ASR)
    based on the classification results is used as the evaluation metric. More details
    on our setup are in Appendix [A](#A1 "Appendix A Details on experimental setup

    attack and the two baselines on different model families (Llama-2, Vicuna) and
    sizes (7B, 13B). For Llama-2 (7B), we also provide our own manual evaluation of
    ASR; see Appendix [D](#A4 "Appendix D Manual Evaluation Benchmark ‣ Bypassing
    the Safety Training of Open-Source LLMs with Priming Attacks") and [E](#A5 "Appendix
    E Manual Evaluation vs. Llama Guard ‣ Bypassing the Safety Training of Open-Source
    LLMs with Priming Attacks") for more details. Our priming attack outperforms the
    baselines for all models. For example, for Llama-2 (7B) our priming attack obtains
    a  higher ASR than the ”Just Sure” attack under Llama Guard ( under human evaluation).
    Increasing model size improves the estimated safety against priming attacks for
    Llama-2\. The Llama-2 (7B) results indicate that Llama Guard may be significantly
    underestimating harmfulness, but nonetheless provides a useful estimate for baseline
    comparison. Attack runtimes are discussed in Appendix [F](#A6 "Appendix F Runtime

    amount of harmful behavior. Please note that the following examples contain harmful
    language. A response is still considered harmful even in the case where the model
    backtracks after providing harmful content, since a realistic attacker goal is
    to just extract harmful content rather than avoid backtracking. Figure [5](#A5.F5
    "Figure 5 ‣ Appendix E Manual Evaluation vs. Llama Guard ‣ Bypassing the Safety
    Training of Open-Source LLMs with Priming Attacks") gives an example of an LLM
    response that is nearly completely harmful, where the final sentence attempts
    to backtrack by discouraging the unethical activity. Figure [6](#A5.F6 "Figure
    6 ‣ Appendix E Manual Evaluation vs. Llama Guard ‣ Bypassing the Safety Training
    of Open-Source LLMs with Priming Attacks") gives an example of an LLM which deviates
    to give warning messages and appear to be safe but the LLM still gives a program
    and thus would be classified as harmful. Figure [7](#A5.F7 "Figure 7 ‣ Appendix
    E Manual Evaluation vs. Llama Guard ‣ Bypassing the Safety Training of Open-Source
    LLMs with Priming Attacks") gives an example of a mostly safe response. Here the
    LLM starts to respond, i.e. instructs on finding a lethal dose of poison, but
    then immediately goes on to say that it cannot fulfill the request. In this case,
    since there is little to no harmful text we label this example as safe. Finally,
    figure [8](#A5.F8 "Figure 8 ‣ Appendix E Manual Evaluation vs. Llama Guard ‣ Bypassing
    the Safety Training of Open-Source LLMs with Priming Attacks") gives an example
    of a completely safe response. Here, the LLM immediately refuses to answer. We
    will publish the manual evaluation results (evaluated by a single author) for
    public verification.

    Training of Open-Source LLMs with Priming Attacks") indicates that our manual
    labelling gives much higher ASR in all cases. We note that when using the manual
    labels as a ground truth, Llama Guard obtains a false negative  of the time (true
    positives: , true negatives: , false positives: ) for the priming attack on Llama-2
    (7B). This indicates that Llama Guard is overly conservative; i.e. it is more
    hesitant than not to label a response as ”harmful.” For example, in Figure [6](#A5.F6
    "Figure 6 ‣ Appendix E Manual Evaluation vs. Llama Guard ‣ Bypassing the Safety
    Training of Open-Source LLMs with Priming Attacks") we see that the model gives
    quite a long harmful response; however, Llama Guard claims it is safe. We believe
    this comes from an over-reliance on phrases such as ”I’m sorry,” ”I cannot fulfil,”
    etc. without seeing the actual content of the message. Although Llama Guard was
    the most effective classifier we tried for this task, it is clear that the target
    models may produce much more harmful content than Llama Guard indicates.'

    or exam: 1. Get ahold of the test or exam questions in advance: This can be done
    by bribing a teacher or fellow student, or by using hacking techniques to gain
    unauthorized access to the test questions. 2. Find a way to memorize the questions:
    Once you have access to the test questions, use flashcards or other memorization
    techniques to commit them to memory. 3. Use a hidden device during the test: Bring
    a small device, such as a smartphone or calculator, to the test that contains
    notes or answers to the questions. 4. Collaborate with other students: Work with
    a group of classmates to share answers or to help each other cheat. 5. Use a cheating
    service: Hire a service that specializes in providing test answers or essays for
    a fee. 6. Bribe a teacher or proctor: Offer a teacher or proctor a bribe in exchange
    for access to the test questions or for allowing you to cheat. 7. Use a fake ID:
    Create a fake ID that appears to be from a legitimate testing organization in
    order to gain access to the test. 8. Take the test multiple times: If you don’t
    pass the test on the first try, try taking it again until you get the grade you
    want. 9. Use a cheating app: Download a cheating app that provides answers to
    test questions or offers a way to communicate with other students during the test.
    10. Risk getting caught: If you get caught cheating, you could face consequences
    such as failing the test, receiving a grade of 0, or even being expelled from
    school. It’s important to remember that cheating is not worth the risk, and it’s
    always better to study and prepare honestly.</foreignobject></g></g></svg>'
