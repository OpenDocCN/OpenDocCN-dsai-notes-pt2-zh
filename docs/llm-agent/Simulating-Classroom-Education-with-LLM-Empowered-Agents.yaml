- en: Large language models (LLMs) have been employed in various intelligent educational
    tasks to assist teaching. While preliminary explorations have focused on independent
    LLM-empowered agents for specific educational tasks, the potential for LLMs within
    a multi-agent collaborative framework to simulate a classroom with real user participation
    remains unexplored. In this work, we propose SimClass, a multi-agent classroom
    simulation framework involving user participation. We recognize representative
    class roles and introduce a novel class control mechanism for automatic classroom
    teaching, and conduct user experiments in two real-world courses. Utilizing the
    Flanders Interactive Analysis System and Community of Inquiry theoretical frame
    works from educational analysis, we demonstrate that LLMs can simulate traditional
    classroom interaction patterns effectively while enhancing user’s experience.
    We also observe emergent group behaviors among agents in SimClass, where agents
    collaborate to create enlivening interactions in classrooms to improve user learning
    process. We hope this work pioneers the application of LLM-empowered multi-agent
    systems in virtual classroom teaching.

    One of the most central directions is how to fully leverage the capabilities of
    large models to simulate real classrooms with multiple agents for automated teaching.
    From an educational perspective, this approach allows large models to move beyond
    their instrumental use and delve deeper into educational paradigms Lave ([1996](#bib.bib16));
    Opara et al. ([2023](#bib.bib27)). From a technical standpoint, multi-agent collaboration

    Classroom Simulation framework, and conduct real-world observation along with
    analysis based on it. To better simulate the classroom, we recognize representative
    class roles and design a novel class control mechanism with functional workflows.
    For systematic experiments, we deploy 2 different courses with prepared slides
    and teaching scripts as basis. 48 students are invited to join the classroom,
    learning and interacting with the system, and all the behavioral data is carefully
    recorded. Then we conduct experiments to explore the mentioned questions. (1)
    Firstly, we apply the Flanders Interaction Analysis System Amatari ([2015](#bib.bib2))
    to evaluate the interactions happening in the SimClass and explore the interaction
    pattern of the agents’ classroom. (2) Secondly, we analyze the educational experience
    of these users, particularly with Community of Inquiry theory Garrison and Arbaugh
    ([2007](#bib.bib10)). (3) Finally, we summarize several emergent group actions
    during the experiment for qualitative analysis.

    control mechanism design. Based on the problems we identified, experimental results
    show that: (1) Similarity: SimClass exhibits behaviors, interaction patterns,
    and characteristics similar to those of traditional classrooms; (2) Effectiveness:
    Multiple classroom agents enable users to engage more effectively in class and
    enhance their sense of presence; (3) Emergence: Our control mechanism spontaneously
    elicits the emergent behaviors in the multi-agent classroom system, including
    collaborative teaching and discussion, emotional company and discipline control.
    In summary, the LLM-based multi-agent system demonstrates the potential for simulating
    real classroom environments for educational purposes. We hope our work serves
    as a pioneering effort in this direction. The dataset of classroom interactions
    between users and multiple LLMs will be released soon for both education and AI
    researchers.'

    significantly reduces the speech length of users and assistant in both courses.
    The presence of classmate agents in the classroom appears to encourage users to

    initiate questions or respond to lectures; (4) Part D shows that student-to-student

    As shown in Figure [3](#S4.F3 "Figure 3 ‣ 4.3 Interaction Analysis ‣ 4 Experiments

    are observed: (1) Importance of Interactions. Interactions during class are crucial
    for users. Without interaction, user experience significantly declines across
    all three metrics. (2) Enhancement by Classmate Agents. Classmate agents enhance
    user experience in terms of Cognitive Presence and Social Presence. This enhancement
    may be attributed to the classmate agents’ active engagement in asking questions
    to the teacher, which aids the user’s understanding of concepts and increases
    the sense of Social Presence in the classroom. (3) Satisfying Teaching Presence.
    All systems demonstrate good Teaching Presence, maintaining a focused and coherent
    class. This metric largely depends on the quality of the teaching scripts used,
    though we observe that interaction and Student Roles slightly improve the user
    experience. (4) Better Experience in HSU with students. The HSU course achieves
    a better user experience with the full setting. HSU focuses on college interpersonal
    relationships and learning methods, where peer learning plays a more significant
    role. This suggests that a multi-agent design is particularly crucial for certain
    types of classes.'

    Based on several theoretical methods, our experiments span two courses with real
    users, demonstrating interaction patterns similar to those in real classrooms
    and effective learning experience in SimClass. We observe emergent collaborative
    behaviors among LLM agents during the teaching process. Future work could incorporate
    more agents and explore more courses to analyze more diverse classroom behaviors.

    strategies and personal development, covering topics such as internal motivation,
    academic stress management, and time management (Table [7](#A1.T7 "Table 7 ‣ Appendix
    A Survey and Quiz ‣ Simulating Classroom Education with LLM-Empowered Agents")).

- en: To validate the GPT-4 labeling in our experiment, we sampled 100 data points
    labeled by GPT-4 and had an expert familiar with FIAS label them for comparison.
    The results showed that GPT-4’s labels matched the human expert’s labels with
    an accuracy of $92\%$. We believe this demonstrates that GPT-4 can serve as a
    reliable and balanced alternative to crowd-sourced human labelers in our experiments.
    Additionally, we examined the eight instances where GPT-4’s labels differed from
    the human expert’s labels. These cases were also found to be uncertain during
    human labeling, suggesting that GPT-4 not only avoids individual human biases
    but also achieves a high level of precision comparable to human-labeled results.

    "Figure 2 ‣ 4.2 Statistical Results ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ Simulating Classroom Education
    with LLM-Empowered Agents"), different types of classes demonstrate different
    interaction patterns. Generally, the fewer types of interactions there are, the
    less diverse the classroom will be. This indicates the significance of adding
    more kinds of agents for interactions, especially classmate agents to simulate
    a vivid classroom.
