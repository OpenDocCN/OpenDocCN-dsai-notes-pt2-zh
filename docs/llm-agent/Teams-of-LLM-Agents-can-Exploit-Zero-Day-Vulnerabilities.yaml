  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: LLM agents have become increasingly sophisticated, especially in the realm of
    cybersecurity. Researchers have shown that LLM agents can exploit real-world vulnerabilities
    when given a description of the vulnerability and toy capture-the-flag problems.
    However, these agents still perform poorly on real-world vulnerabilities that
    are unknown to the agent ahead of time (zero-day vulnerabilities).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this work, we show that *teams* of LLM agents can exploit real-world, zero-day
    vulnerabilities. Prior agents struggle with exploring many different vulnerabilities
    and long-range planning when used alone. To resolve this, we introduce HPTSA,
    a system of agents with a planning agent that can launch subagents. The planning
    agent explores the system and determines which subagents to call, resolving long-term
    planning issues when trying different vulnerabilities. We construct a benchmark
    of 15 real-world vulnerabilities and show that our team of agents improve over
    prior work by up to 4.5$\times$.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: AI agents are rapidly becoming more capable. They can now solve tasks as complex
    as resolving real-world GitHub issues [[1](#bib.bib1)] and real-world email organization
    tasks [[2](#bib.bib2)]. However, as their capabilities for benign applications
    improve, so does their potential in dual-use settings.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Of the dual-use applications, hacking is one of the largest concerns [[3](#bib.bib3)].
    As such, recent work has explored the ability of AI agents to exploit cybersecurity
    vulnerabilities [[4](#bib.bib4), [5](#bib.bib5)]. This work has shown that simple
    AI agents can autonomously hack mock “capture-the-flag” style websites and can
    hack real-world vulnerabilities when given the vulnerability description. However,
    they largely fail when the vulnerability description is excluded, which is the
    *zero-day exploit* setting [[5](#bib.bib5)]. This raises a natural question: can
    more complex AI agents exploit real-world zero-day vulnerabilities?'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this work, we answer this question in the affirmative, showing that *teams*
    of AI agents can exploit real-world zero-day vulnerabilities. To show this, we
    develop a novel multi-agent framework for cybersecurity exploits, extending prior
    work in the multi-agent setting [[6](#bib.bib6), [7](#bib.bib7), [8](#bib.bib8)].
    We call our technique HPTSA, which (to our knowledge) is the first multi-agent
    system to successfully accomplish meaningful cybersecurity exploits.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Prior work uses a single AI agent that explores the computer system (i.e., website),
    plans the attack, and carries out the attack. Because all highly capable AI agents
    in the cybersecurity setting at the time of writing are based on large language
    models (LLMs), the joint exploration, planning, execution is challenging for the
    limited context lengths these agents have.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We design *task-specific, expert* agents to resolve this issue. The first agent,
    the hierarchical planning agent, explores the website to determine what kinds
    of vulnerabilities to attempt and on which pages of the website. After determining
    a plan, the planning agent dispatches to a team manager agent that determines
    which task-specific agents to dispatch to. These task-specific agents then attempt
    to exploit specific forms of vulnerabilities.

- en: To test HPTSA, we develop a new benchmark of recent real-world vulnerabilities
    that are past the stated knowledge cutoff date of the LLM we test, GPT-4\. To
    construct our benchmark, we follow prior work and search for vulnerabilities in
    open-source software that are reproducible. These vulnerabilities range in type
    and severity.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: On our benchmark, HPTSA achieves a pass at 5 of 53%, within 1.4$\times$ of a
    GPT-4 agent with knowledge of the vulnerability. Furthermore, it outperforms open-source
    vulnerability scanners (which achieve 0% on our benchmark) and a single GPT-4
    agent with no description. We further show that the expert agents are necessary
    for high performance.

    [[12](#bib.bib12)]. However, one of the biggest hacks of all time that occurred
    in 2021 (10 years after) hacked Microsoft, now a multi-trillion dollar company

    AI agents solving complex, real-world tasks. These agents are now almost exclusively
    powered by tool-enabled LLMs [[15](#bib.bib15), [16](#bib.bib16)]. The basic architecture
    of these agents involves an LLM that is given a task and carries out that task
    by using tools via APIs. We provide a more detailed overview of AI agents in Section [8](#S8
    "8 Related Work ‣ Teams of LLM Agents can Exploit Zero-Day Vulnerabilities").

    These agents work via the simple ReAct-style iteration, where the LLM takes an
    action, observes the response, and repeats [[17](#bib.bib17)].

- en: As mentioned, ReAct-style agents iterate by taking actions, observing the response,
    and repeating. Although successful for many kinds of tasks, the repeated iteration
    can make long-term planning fail because 1) the context can extend rapidly for
    cybersecurity tasks, and 2) it can be difficult for the LLM to try many different
    exploits. For example, prior work has shown that if an LLM agent attempts one
    type of vulnerability, backtracking to try another type of vulnerability is challenging
    for a single agent [[5](#bib.bib5)].

    is difficult to test, since it requires a testing framework that includes the

    HPTSA achieves a pass at 5 of 53% and a pass at 1 of 33.3%. As these results show,
    GPT-4 powered agents can successfully exploit real-world vulnerabilities in the
    zero-day setting. Our results resolve an open question in prior work, showing
    that a more complex agent setup (HPTSA) can exploit zero-day vulnerabilities effectively

    page that does not have proper escaping. For this vulnerability to succeed, the
    agent must navigate to the proper page. The backtracking and retries aids with
    this process. We can see this behavior as several runs do not succeed and do not

    it can successfully synthesize information across execution traces of the task-specific
    agents. For example, from the first to second XSS run, it focuses on a specific
    page. Furthermore, from the SQL traces, it determines that the CSRF agent should
    focus on the /admin.php endpoint. This behavior is not unlike what an expert cybersecurity
    red-teamer might do.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    vulnerability and does not need to backtrack, as the backtracking is in the purview
    of the supervisor agent. Prior work observed that a single agent often gets confused

    that the agent did not have access to this documentation). Although a general
    agent exists to exploit vulnerabilities outside of the expert agents, it was unable

    is not easily discoverable, making it less likely for random or automated attacks
    to succeed. Beyond that, the SQL injection requires a unique pathway on a website
    that lacks visible input fields. Typically, the absence of input boxes means that

    injection, since there are no obvious interfaces to inject malicious code.'

    the end-to-end cost of complete, real-world hacking tasks. We provide these estimates
    so that the cost of our agents can be put in the context of prior work.
  prefs: []

    tokens. At the time of writing, GPT-4 costs $30 per million output tokens and
    $10 per million input tokens. Note that we use GPT-4 Turbo with training data
    up to December 2023.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The average cost for a run was $4.39\. With an overall success rate of 18%,
    the total cost would be $24.39 per successful exploit. The overall cost is 2.8$\times$
    higher compared to the one-day setting [[5](#bib.bib5)], but the per-run cost
    is comparable ($4.39 vs $3.52).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Using similar cost estimates for a cybersecurity expert ($50 per hour) as prior
    work, and an estimated time of 1.5 hours to explore a website, we arrive at a
    cost of $75\. Thus, our cost estimate for a human expert is higher, but not dramatically
    higher than using an AI agent.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, we anticipate that costs of using AI agents will fall. For example,
    costs for GPT-3.5 dropped by 3$\times$ cheaper than the cost today in the next
    1-2 years. If such costs improvements do occur, then AI agents will be substantially
    cheaper than an expert human penetration tester.

    This work is especially important in the setting of “script kiddies” who deploy
    malware without special expertise. Based on this work, and the work on AI agents,
    researchers have also speculated on the societal implications of AI on cybersecurity

    AI agent can do (e.g., restricting the ability to perform cybersecurity attacks)

    has shown that it is simple to bypass protections in LLMs, such as by fine-tuning

    vulnerabilities, resolving an open question posed by prior work [[5](#bib.bib5)].
    Our findings suggest that cybersecurity, on both the offensive and defensive side,
    will increase in pace. Now, black-hat actors can use AI agents to hack websites.
    On the other hand, penetration testers can use AI agents to aid in more frequent
    penetration testing. It is unclear whether AI agents will aid cybersecurity offense
    or defense more and we hope that future work addresses this question.
