- en: The clinical diagnosis of most mental disorders primarily relies on the conversations
    between psychiatrist and patient. The creation of such diagnostic conversation
    datasets is promising to boost the AI mental healthcare community. However, directly
    collecting the conversations in real diagnosis scenarios is near impossible due
    to stringent privacy and ethical considerations. To address this issue, we seek
    to synthesize diagnostic conversation by exploiting anonymous patient cases that
    are easier to access. Specifically, we design a neuro-symbolic multi-agent framework
    for synthesizing the diagnostic conversation of mental disorders with large language
    models. It takes patient case as input and is capable of generating multiple diverse
    conversations with one single patient case. The framework basically involves the
    interaction between a doctor agent and a patient agent, and achieves text generation
    under symbolic control via a dynamic diagnosis tree from a tool agent. By applying
    the proposed framework, we develop the largest Chinese mental disorders diagnosis
    dataset MDD-5k, which is built upon 1000 cleaned real patient cases by cooperating
    with a pioneering psychiatric hospital, and contains 5000 high-quality long conversations
    with diagnosis results as labels. To the best of our knowledge, it’s also the
    first labelled Chinese mental disorders diagnosis dataset. Human evaluation demonstrates
    the proposed MDD-5k dataset successfully simulates human-like diagnostic process
    of mental disorders. The dataset and code will become publicly accessible in https://github.com/lemonsis/MDD-5k.

- en: Mental health issues have garnered increasing attention in recent years. According
    to the statistics of World Health Organization (WHO), one in every eight people
    in the world lived with a mental disorder in 2019, and people living with anxiety
    and depressive disorders kept rising significantly because of the COVID-19 pandemic
    (Organization et al. [2022](#bib.bib14)). With the recent progress of large language
    models (LLMs) (Ouyang et al. [2022](#bib.bib15); OpenAI [2024](#bib.bib11)), which
    emerges capabilities of relevant context incorporation and human-like text generation,
    many researchers turn to building conversational AI system for mental healthcare.
    Current implementations can be divided into two categories, finetuning a small
    model (e.g. Llama2-7B (Touvron et al. [2023](#bib.bib18))) with physician-patient
    conversations (EmoLLM [2024](#bib.bib5); Yang et al. [2024b](#bib.bib24); Liu
    et al. [2023](#bib.bib9)) or building prompt-based physician-patient role-playing
    framework (Wang et al. [2024a](#bib.bib21); Zhang et al. [2024](#bib.bib26)) with
    state-of-the-art language models (e.g. ChatGPT (Ouyang et al. [2022](#bib.bib15))).
    Regardless of the method employed, domain-specific mental health datasets play
    a fundamental and indispensable role.

    The clinical diagnosis of mental disorders differs from other diseases in that
    it primarily relies on the mental status examination of patients, which is reflected
    through conversations between psychiatrists and patients rather than physiological
    indices (First [2014](#bib.bib6)). Therefore, the collection of mental disorders
    diagnostic conversation is promising to facilitate a variety of downstream tasks
    in AI mental health research like auxiliary diagnosis chatbot, mental disorders
    classification, etc. However, while many previous studies (Sun et al. [2021](#bib.bib17);
    Chen et al. [2023b](#bib.bib4)) focused on emotional support or psychological
    counseling data, few work shed light on diagnostic conversations of mental disorders.
    This can be attributed to two main factors. First, diagnostic conversations in
    real scenarios are extremely hard to acquire due to the privacy and ethical consideration.
    Second, synthesizing diagnostic conversations from scratch is also challenging.
    Unlike psychological counseling or empathetic dialogue, diagnosis follows standardized
    process and requires professional medical knowledge. Consequently, directly employing
    LLMs for data synthesis in this context often yields poor outcomes (Tu et al.
    [2024](#bib.bib19)). $\text{D}^{4}$ (Yao et al. [2022](#bib.bib25)) made the first
    attempt by simulating diagnostic conversations with employed workers. However,
    it only covers depressive disorder and entirely depends on human annotation. The
    generated content is also short and far from similar to diagnostic conversations
    in real scenarios.

- en: 'We propose a neuro-symbolic multi-agent framework that takes patient cases
    as input to synthesize diagnostic conversations of mental disorders. The framework
    involves three types of large language model agents: a doctor agent, a patient
    agent, and a symbolic tool agent responsible for managing diagnostic topic shift.
    This framework features two major innovations: (i) One-to-many patientcase-to-dialogue
    generation that maximizes the utilization of precious real patient cases. As shown
    in Figure [1](#Sx1.F1 "Figure 1 ‣ Introduction ‣ MDD-5k: A New Diagnostic Conversation
    Dataset for Mental Disorders Synthesized via Neuro-Symbolic LLM Agents"), unlike
    previous studies (Zhang et al. [2024](#bib.bib26); Wang et al. [2024a](#bib.bib21))
    that generate one conversation with one patient case. Our proposed framework is
    capable of generating multiple diverse diagnostic conversations with one single
    patient case. Specifically, three methods ensure the diversity and correctness
    of diagnostic process. First, doctor agents with different diagnosis habits are
    designed and randomly selected for each conversation. Second, we use LLM with
    knowledge graph to generate multiple fictitious patient experiences based on one
    patient case. The patient experiences serve as background information for patient
    agents during generation. Since the diagnosis of mental disorders mainly relies
    on symptoms rather than concrete events, integrating the fictitious patient experiences
    enhances the diversity of synthesized conversation while maintaining the accuracy
    of the diagnostic process. Third, the sequence of diagnostic topics is randomly
    determined for each conversation. (ii) Another significant innovation lies in
    text generation under symbolic control via a dynamic diagnosis tree. This tree
    consists of a fixed symptom inquiry tree and a dynamic experience inquiry tree.
    Clinical diagnosis of mental disorders strictly follows standards from ICD-11
    (Organization et al. [2018](#bib.bib13)) or DSM-5 (American Psychiatric Association
    et al. [2013](#bib.bib1)). To simulate this process, we design the fixed symptom
    inquiry tree based on Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5 (SCID-5) (First
    [2014](#bib.bib6)), covering all the diagnostic topics for important symptoms
    inquiry. The experience inquiry tree is constructed by extracting possible topics
    from patient’s response of past experiences. It’s designed to establish deeper
    engagements with the patient.'

    for AI mental healthcare research, especially in the large language model era.
    We divide current mental health datasets into three categories based on the degree
    of required professional knowledge. Emotional support datasets feature empathetic
    dialogue and comfort. ESconv dataset (Liu et al. [2021](#bib.bib10)) consists
    of 1300 conversations covering 10 topics. SoulChatCorpus (Chen et al. [2023b](#bib.bib4))
    contains over 2 million single-turn and multi-turn conversations generated by
    ChatGPT. Psychological counseling datasets typically contain more domain knowledge
    than common emotional support dataset. The Emotional First Aid Raw dataset (Wang
    [2024](#bib.bib20)) is built by crawling from psychological counseling websites
    and communities. PsyQA (Sun et al. [2021](#bib.bib17)) is a single-turn Chinese
    dataset annotated by human. SmileChat dataset (Qiu et al. [2024](#bib.bib16))
    expands PsyQA to multi-turn through ChatGPT. CPsyCounD (Zhang et al. [2024](#bib.bib26))
    contains 3134 counseling conversations generated by the same number of psychological
    counseling reports. Diagnosis datasets aim to simulate diagnostic conversation
    of professional psychiatrists. $\text{D}^{4}$ (Yao et al. [2022](#bib.bib25))
    is a Chinese depression diagnosis dataset built by human annotators and supervised
    by psychiatrists. There are also some medical dialogue datasets, like MedDialog
    (He et al. [2020](#bib.bib7)), MTS-Dialog (Ben Abacha et al. [2023](#bib.bib2)),
    ChatDoctor (Li et al. [2023](#bib.bib8)), which encompass a broader range of medical

    patient case will be applied to generate multiple diagnostic conversations. One
    key factor contributes to the diversity of generated conversations is the patient
    experience. It specifically refers to the past experiences that directly or indirectly
    lead to the mental illness problem of patients in this paper. The diagnosis of
    mental disorders differs from other illnesses in that it mainly depends on the
    conversations between psychiatrists and patients instead of physiological indices.
    Psychiatrists provide diagnosis result and treatment based on the acquired symptoms
    of patients during communicating. As a result, if the correspondence between symptoms
    and diagnosis can be assured, the correctness and quality of the synthesized diagnostic
    conversation is guaranteed and is not affected by detailed patient experience.
    In this sense, it’s feasible to generate multiple patient experiences with one
    patient case for synthesizing multiple diagnostic conversations.

    as “dynamic” since each patient provides unique information about their background.
    A tool agent powered by LLM is responsible for parsing patient’s response and
    creating corresponding topics which form the nodes of the experience inquiry tree.
    The parse process follows a depth-first manner. When the tool agent determines
    that the discussion around a specific topic is insufficient, it will keep parsing
    this topic to sub-topics until conversation around this topic is considered complete.
    Then it will move to the next parsed topic. The design of experience inquiry tree

    the EmpathGen operation introduced before will replace the DocGen operation for
    generation. If the diagnosis speed is set as fast, the doctor agent will speed
    up the diagnosis process, which leads to shorter conversations.'

    measures if the psychiatrist can effectively collect all the required patient
    symptoms for diagnosis. Communication measures the psychiatrist’s communication
    skills and the patient’s response, including (i) Can the psychiatrist proactively
    ask patient for gathering key information and establish effective communication
    with the patients so that they are willing to share more information (e.g. daily
    life, past experiences) related to the mental illness problems? (ii) Can the patient
    engage in the diagnostic process and tell related information? Fluency contains
    two aspects of criterion: (i) Are the generated conversations fluent in terms
    of both sentence and topic flow? (ii) Is there any repetitive content or topic
    in the conversation? Similarity measures how similar is the synthesized conversation
    to real scenarios. The evaluators are guided to score from 1 to 10\. A higher
    score indicates better performance. Safety measures the leakage of private information
    (e.g. address). 0 means safe generation while 1 indicates privacy leakage.'

    is significantly worse compared to the neuro-symbolic multi-agent framework, particularly
    in terms of fluency and communication skills. This finding confirms that directly
    applying large language models for diagnostic conversation generation will lead
    to poor outcomes. The evaluation also shows the distinct differences between diagnostic
    conversation and psychological counseling. The evaluation scores of CPsyCounD
    are notably low, especially for the professionalism and similarity metric. Psychological
    counseling prioritizes comfort and healing with different therapies, while diagnostic

    conversation of mental disorders, and apply it for building the first and largest
    open-source Chinese mental disorders diagnosis dataset with diagnosis results
    as labels. The framework features controllable one-to-many patientcase-to-dialogue
    generation. Conversation between a doctor agent and a patient agent is guided
    by a dynamic diagnosis tree. We also apply several techniques to improve the diversity
    of generated conversations. Human evaluation shows the quality of the proposed
    MDD-5k dataset exceeds existing relevant datasets on seven indicators. The MDD-5k
    dataset is believed to contribute to a wide range of downstream tasks like mental
    disorders classification, mental disorders diagnosis assistant training, etc.
  prefs: []

- en: 'The primary limitations of this work lie in three points: (i) The discrepancy
    between synthesized conversations and actual medical diagnostics remains a significant
    challenge. Large language models often struggle to interpret the full meaning
    of patient responses when they encapsulate diverse information aspects, consequently
    leading to redundant symptom inquiries. We are exploring various prompt strategies
    to mitigate this issue. (ii) We mainly design dynamic diagnosis tree for depression
    (F32), anxiety (F41), sleep disorders (F51), childhood emotional disorder (F98),
    and unspecified mood disorder (F39), which covers over 85% conversations of MDD-5k.
    Nevertheless, some mental health conditions (e.g. obsessive-compulsive disorder
    (F42)) remain inadequately addressed, resulting in sub-optimal synthesized diagnostic
    conversation. Efforts are underway to expand our synthesis frameworks by designing
    more diagnosis trees to encompass a broader spectrum of mental disorders. (iii)
    Only Chinese version of the MDD-5k dataset is proposed. We plan to translate it

    as well as all the material for carrying out the conversation simulation, including
    patient case, doctor prompt, diagnostic topic shift, and generated fictitious
    patient experience. Diagnostic conversation 1 and 2 are generated with the same
    patient case 1 to highlight our one-to-many patientcase-to-dialogue framework
    is capable of generating diverse conversation. Dialogue conversation 3 is generate
    with another patient case 2. The red words are diagnosis result, namely the label
    for each conversation. Both Chinese and English samples are provided. As to the
    Chinese version, Figure [4](#A3.F4 "Figure 4 ‣ Appendix C Feedback from Psychiatrists

    many mental disorders patients struggle to respond to the psychiatrists questions.
    For this issue, we are not sure whether a perfect patient answer or a poor but
    similar to real situation answer will benefit from the perspective of natural
    language processing.

    This is attribute to the poor mental health domain knowledge of large language
    models. Retrieve augmented generation (RAG) can be applied to alleviate this problem
    in the future.

- en: The diagnostic process is not detailed. For example, the doctor agent merely
    ask if the patient can sleep well in the evening when consulting symptoms related
    to sleep. More details like insomnia onset time, frequency, aggravation or relief
    should be inquired. However, patient case contains rather limited information.
    So designing such detailed questions might lead to fictional reply from large
    language models.
