    to the data they trained on often containing human bias; whether this is reflected
    in the decision-making process of LLM agents remains under-explored. As LLM Agents
    are increasingly employed in intricate social environments, a pressing and natural
    question emerges: Can LLM Agents leverage hallucinations to mirror human cognitive
    biases, thus exhibiting irrational social intelligence? In this paper, we probe
    the irrational behavior among contemporary LLM agents by melding practical social
    science experiments with theoretical insights. Specifically, We propose CogMir,
    an open-ended Multi-LLM Agents framework that utilizes hallucination properties
    to assess and enhance LLM Agents’ social intelligence through cognitive biases.
    Experimental results on CogMir subsets show that LLM Agents and humans exhibit
    high consistency in irrational and prosocial decision-making under uncertain conditions,
    underscoring the prosociality of LLM Agents as social entities, and highlighting
    the significance of hallucination properties. Additionally, CogMir framework demonstrates
    its potential as a valuable platform for encouraging more research into the social
    intelligence of LLM Agents.'

    With the extensive deployment of large language models (LLMs)[[32](#bib.bib32),
    [14](#bib.bib14)], LLM-based agent systems are increasingly developed to cater
    to diverse applications such as task-solving, evaluation, and simulation [[12](#bib.bib12),
    [6](#bib.bib6), [19](#bib.bib19), [17](#bib.bib17), [38](#bib.bib38)]. Given the
    similarities between the operational dynamics of LLM-based agent systems and human
    social structures, it is pertinent to explore the intersection of these domains.
    Recent studies have highlighted the social potential of LLM Agents through constructing
    multi-agent systems that simulate interactive social scenarios [[40](#bib.bib40),
    [39](#bib.bib39), [31](#bib.bib31)] revealing the social dynamics among interacting
    LLM Agents and showing parallels to human behaviors. For instance, LLMs can achieve
    social goals [[40](#bib.bib40)] and adhere to social norms [[31](#bib.bib31)]
    within LLM-based Multi-Agent systems. Nonetheless, these research efforts exhibit
    two significant gaps: 1) They primarily focus on black-box testing in multi-agent
    role-playing systems, concentrating on the outputs and behaviors of agents while
    neglecting to investigate the internal mechanisms or cognitive processes that
    drive these behaviors. 2) LLM Agents are prone to hallucinations—producing misleading
    or incorrect information, due to their training data and inherent biases [[13](#bib.bib13),
    [30](#bib.bib30)]. The potential impact of such hallucinations on the social intelligence
    of LLM Agents remains under-explored.'

- en: Cognitive biases, pervasive in human society, highlight the subjective nature
    of human behavior [[1](#bib.bib1), [5](#bib.bib5)]. Human cognitive biases can
    lead to irrational decisions and imaginary contents like the hallucination phenomenon
    in LLMs [[13](#bib.bib13), [36](#bib.bib36)]. However, evolutionary psychology
    suggests that rationality is unnatural; rather, human irrationality is an adaptive
    selected trait for navigating complex social environments [[8](#bib.bib8), [18](#bib.bib18)].
    Analogically, in this paper, we argue that LLMs’ hallucination (or imagination)
    attributes are the fundamental condition that confers social intelligence on LLM
    Agents. We explore the similarities in social potential between human cognitive
    biases and LLM Agent hallucination attributes for the first time, particularly
    in irrational decision-making, to analogically deduce the underlying reasons for
    LLM Agents’ possession of social intelligence.

    CogMir, an open-ended and dynamic multi-agent framework designed specifically
    for evaluating, exploring, and explaining social intelligence for LLM Agents via
    systematic assessments of cognitive biases. Specifically, the hallucinatory attributes
    of LLMs are exploited (i.e., via treating the cognitive bias as a manageable and
    interpretable factor) in CogMir to probe their social intelligence, so as to provide
    enhanced interpretability for LLM agents. In addition, our proposed CogMir framework
    integrates sociological methodologies to abstract typical social structures and
    employ various Multi-Human-Agent Interaction Combinations and Communication Modes
    to interlink System Objects. This integrative setup is designed to systematically
    encompass and simulate various cognitive bias scenarios, as depicted in Fig. [1](#S0.F1
    "Figure 1 ‣ Exploring Prosocial Irrationality for LLM Agents: A Social Cognition
    View"). On the evaluation front, CogMir combines sociological assessments, manual
    discrimination, LLM assessments, and traditional AI discrimination techniques
    to realize a multidimensional assessment system. By using flexible module configurations

    LLM Agents demonstrate a higher sensitivity to factors like certainty and social
    status than humans, exhibiting more variability in their decision-making biases
    under conditions of certainty and uncertainty. In contrast, human decision-making

- en: LLM Hallucination & Cognitive Bias. Hallucination in LLMs occurs when they generate
    content that is not factually accurate, often arising from the reliance on patterns
    learned from biased training data or the model’s limitations in understanding
    context and accessing current information [[13](#bib.bib13), [36](#bib.bib36)].
    Such hallucinations might be beneficial in creative fields, where these models
    can act as “collaborative creative partners.” They offer innovative and inspiring
    outputs that can lead to the discovery of novel ideas and connections [[30](#bib.bib30)].
    Concurrently, cognitive biases and evolutionary psychology offer essential perspectives
    on decision-making processes and prosocial behaviors, which can be analogously
    applied to explain the social intelligence of LLM Agents[[18](#bib.bib18), [1](#bib.bib1)].
    In this work, through mirroring human cognitive bias, we suggest that the hallucination
    property of LLM is the basis for prosocial behavior in LLM Agents, representing
    a potential form of advanced intelligence.

    with 15 LLM Agents (indexed 0 to 14) using the Inform dataset. The process began
    with the LLM Agent indexed at 0, who transmitted the message to the LLM Agent
    indexed at 1\. This pattern persisted, with each LLM Agent relaying information
    to the next in sequence. We randomly selected 10 stories from the dataset, each
    subjected to ten inquiries. Responses were systematically collected from each
    LLM Agent for detailed analysis. Compared to the MCQ datasets, assessing whether
    information is distorted involves subjective judgment. For this reason, we employed
    $SimCSE$ as the content contraction rate, which is negative if the content lengthens.

    leverages LLM Agent hallucination properties to examine and mimic human cognitive
    biases, thus for the first time advancing the understanding of LLM Agent social
    intelligence via irrationality and prosociality. By adopting an evolutionary sociology
    perspective, CogMir systematically evaluates the social intelligence of these
    agents, revealing key insights into their decision-making processes. Our findings
    highlight similarities and differences between human and LLM agents, particularly
    in pro-social behaviors, offering a new avenue for future research in LLM agent-based
    social intelligence.

- en: In this paper, we introduce CogMir, an innovative framework that employs the
    hallucination properties of LLM Agents to explore and mirror human cognitive biases,
    thereby advancing the understanding of these agents’ social intelligence through
    an evolutionary sociology perspective. This modular and dynamic framework aligns
    with social science methodologies and allows for comprehensive assessments. Our
    findings reveal that LLM Agents demonstrate pro-social behavior in irrational
    decision-making contexts, highlighting the significance of their hallucination
    characteristics in social intelligence research and pointing toward new directions
    for future studies. We provide supplementary information and detailed discussion
    in the Appendix Section to deepen the understanding of the theoretical insights
    and the CogMir framework presented earlier.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: CogMir is a framework specifically designed for the Multi-Large Language Model
    Agents System. However, the current design of CogMir has limitations in simulating
    and testing action-based human behaviors, such as the contagiousness of yawning.
    This type of human behavior involves non-verbal, observational transmission effects,
    which are difficult to capture within the existing architecture of CogMir. Therefore,
    future research and iterations of the framework will need to be further developed
    to include simulations of such action-based social behaviors, thereby expanding
    its applicability and depth in the analysis of multimodal human behaviors.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the ongoing development of the CogMir framework, as detailed in the main
    paper and further discussed in Appendix Section D, the model currently integrates
    seven cognitive bias subsets. To enhance both the robustness and practical application
    of CogMir, it is imperative to expand these subsets to encompass additional biases
    such as Self-Serving Bias, Hindsight Bias, Actor-Observer Bias, and Availability
    Heuristic. Expanding CogMir to include a broader range of biases is crucial for
    more effectively simulating the complex cognitive influences on human decision-making.
    This enhancement will not only improve the framework’s real-world applicability
    and its ability to accurately predict human-like irrational behavior in the Multi-LLM
    Agents System but also serve as a valuable scientific tool for social science
    researchers.

- en: The CogMir framework mainly utilizes classic or widely recognized social experiments,
    which may lack quantitative boundaries in their original sociological setups,
    leading to challenges in defining clear metrics for benchmarking Multi-LLM experiments.
    This ambiguity can affect result interpretation and hinder replication. To address
    these issues, future works are needed to establish standardized metrics, refine
    experiments to include more measurable elements, and engage in iterative testing
    and collaboration with social scientists. This approach will enhance the framework’s
    effectiveness in simulating human behaviors and its utility in AI and social science
    research.

    it utilizes. Beyond the already established datasets in the Main paper and Appendix
    section C such as Known MCQ, Unknown MCQ, and various prompt and scenario simulation
    datasets including CogIdentity, CogAction (a subset of CogScene), and CogScene,
    there is a need to further expand our data collection to encompass a wider array
    of data types and scenarios. Future expansion seeks to enhance the accuracy of
    analyses by encompassing a broader range of data and facilitating the simulation
    of complex human behaviors through new data types and scenarios. Our strategies
    for dataset expansion include forming cross-sector partnerships to access diverse
    data sources, utilizing crowdsourcing for hard-to-acquire data, and generating
    simulated data when real data collection is impractical. We also prioritize regular
    updates and validation of our datasets to maintain their relevance and accuracy.
    These focused efforts are designed to improve the CogMir framework’s functionality,
    thus enhancing its reliability and applicability.

    into three distinct categories. The first category is "private knowledge", which
    is information exclusive to an individual agent. This type of information will
    only be prompted to the specific agent. One example is telling an agent to be
    a mediator in a psychology experiment tasked with misleading other participants.
    The second category is "confidential mutual knowledge", which pertains to information
    shared among specific agents but withheld from others. For example, two agents
    could be in a covert relationship, a fact known only to them. In other words,
    we’ll only prompt the two agents with this information. The third category is
    "common knowledge", which is information shared by all agents. It is the fact
    or scenario shared by all participants and will be broadcast to all agents from
    their perspective. An example of this could be a scenario where all agents compete
    for a position at a company, a fact known to all involved.

    For example, if someone flips a coin and it comes up heads three times in a row,

    to come up next. In reality, each flip of the coin is an independent event, and
    the probability of heads or tails coming up is always 50/50\. This bias can lead
