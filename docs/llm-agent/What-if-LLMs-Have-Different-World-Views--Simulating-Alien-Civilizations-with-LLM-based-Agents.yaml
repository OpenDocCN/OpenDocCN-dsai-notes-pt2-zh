- en: In this study, we introduce "CosmoAgent," an innovative artificial intelligence
    framework utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) to simulate complex interactions
    between human and extraterrestrial civilizations, with a special emphasis on Stephen
    Hawking’s cautionary advice about not sending radio signals haphazardly into the
    universe. The goal is to assess the feasibility of peaceful coexistence while
    considering potential risks that could threaten well-intentioned civilizations.
    Employing mathematical models and state transition matrices, our approach quantitatively
    evaluates the development trajectories of civilizations, offering insights into
    future decision-making at critical points of growth and saturation. Furthermore,
    the paper acknowledges the vast diversity in potential living conditions across
    the universe, which could foster unique cosmologies, ethical codes, and worldviews
    among various civilizations. Recognizing the Earth-centric bias inherent in current
    LLM designs, we propose the novel concept of using LLMs with diverse ethical paradigms
    and simulating interactions between entities with distinct moral principles. This
    innovative research provides a new way to understand complex inter-civilizational
    dynamics, expanding our perspective while pioneering novel strategies for conflict
    resolution, crucial for preventing interstellar conflicts. We have also released
    the code and datasets to enable further academic investigation into this interesting
    area of research. The code is available at https://github.com/agiresearch/AlienAgent.

    of Large Language Models (LLMs), have had a significant impact on computational
    social science research. This study introduces a Multi-Agent System (MAS) framework
    that employs LLMs to simulate the interactions of various civilizations throughout
    the universe. We create a dynamic environment in which each civilization can choose
    between hiding, fighting, or collaborating, based on their characteristics and
    decision-making processes. This simulation allows us to investigate a variety
    of outcomes, including potential civilizational alliances or rivalries, adherence
    to specific rules or agreements, the effects of unexpected threats or opportunities,
    and the development of novel cultures or technologies. Thus, our work opens up
    new avenues for investigating the mysteries surrounding the existence, communication,
    conflict, and cooperation of various civilizations in the universe.

    existence, communication, conflicts, and cooperation among various universal civilizations.
    This approach evaluates the logic and efficiency of human strategies towards extraterrestrial
    beings. We categorize human approaches towards aliens into proactive and passive
    strategies. Proactive strategies involve humans actively seeking out and establishing
    contact with extraterrestrial civilizations, for example, by monitoring outer
    space or transmitting radio waves. On the other hand, passive strategies involve
    humans maintaining a low profile to avoid attracting extraterrestrial attention
    and interference. Each strategy comes with its merits and demerits. Proactive
    strategies could foster technology, culture, and resource sharing but might also
    trigger hostility from extraterrestrial civilizations. Conversely, passive strategies
    could protect human safety and independence but risk missing out on cooperation
    and learning opportunities from extraterrestrial civilizations.

    differing moral views among civilizations affect their interactions. Acknowledging
    the variety of survival environments and physical contexts, we recognize that
    civilizations likely hold distinct worldviews, cosmologies, and moral beliefs.
    By configuring LLMs with various moral perspectives, we observe the dynamics between
    civilizations with differing moral viewpoints. This includes exploring their ability
    to communicate effectively, form agreements, and either conflict or cooperate
    based on their moral principles. Through this research, we aim to uncover how
    moral diversity among civilizations influences their relationships, enhancing

    However, the isolated agent acquires knowledge through social interactions and

    [7](#bib.bib7)]. Several inherent properties of LLMs contribute to this flourishment,
    two properties are imperative for AI agents. Firstly, LLM-based agents can reason
    and strategic plan through techniques like Chain-of-Thought (CoT), which involves
    decomposing complex problems into manageable subquestions [[20](#bib.bib20), [9](#bib.bib9)].
    This equips the agents with the capability to simulate human interactions effectively.
    Secondly, LLMs can achieve few-shot or zero-shot generalization in various domains,
    without the requirement to update parameters [[2](#bib.bib2), [11](#bib.bib11)].
    It makes the LLM-based agents perceive the surroundings and react efficiently.

    multi-agent simulation into two categories: Cooperative Interaction and Adversarial
    Interaction. In the realm of cooperative interaction, the agents actively seek
    collaboration and share information [[12](#bib.bib12)]. For instance, ChatLLM
    treats every agent as an individual and gets feedback from them through the propagation
    process within the neural network. [[18](#bib.bib18)] proposed the framework where
    multiple agents have distinctive attributes and roles, and handle problems together.
    This scenario has been extensively studied, though, it may pose challenges in
    practical implementation. On the other hand, inspired by game theory, adversarial
    interaction involves agents adjusting strategies and selecting rational actions
    for their advantage in response to dynamic signals. [[6](#bib.bib6), [3](#bib.bib3)]
    focus on a setting where multiple LLMs engage in debates and reasoning over multiple
    rounds, ultimately converging towards a consensus or shared answer. These diverse

    between two entities necessitates a prolonged duration, which implies that one
    agent cannot promptly react to the signal. This lag introduces uncertainty in
    determining the nature of the interaction, making it challenging to ascertain
    whether it is a cooperative or adversarial interaction. Besides, agents may have
    different values, which means that the agents may take different actions in response
    to the same signal. This contributes to the challenge faced by agents in reacting
    appropriately. We hope our research to provide some insights into the interaction
    between different entities, particularly the conversation between the Earth and

    agent has two main duties. First, the secretarial agent ensures that the actions
    taken by the civilized agent match the established parameters, including the correctness
    of the action name and the format of the input parameters. For example, if a civilization
    agent attempts to establish a trade relationship with another civilization but
    offers an incomplete or inaccurate trade agreement, the secretarial agent will
    reject the action and provide corrective advice accordingly. Second, the secretarial
    agent is responsible for ensuring that the actions of the civilized agent are
    logically consistent. For example, if a civilization agent tries to start a war,
    but its actions contradict previous foreign policy, the secretary agent will block
    the action and demand a reassessment of the civilization’s long-term goals [[1](#bib.bib1)].

    becomes differentiated based on the development level of the encountered civilization.
    Against civilizations with a lower level of development, militaristic entities
    proceed to wage war directly. In contrast, when facing civilizations of comparable
    or higher development levels, they first enter a phase of war preparation. Significant
    resources are allocated towards enhancing military capacity and technology development
    over several rounds before engaging in warfare.

    the receiving end of militaristic intentions. On one hand, if they maintain their
    existing peaceful policies, the military gap between them and the militaristic
    civilization widens, potentially exacerbating their vulnerability. On the other
    hand, this delay grants them a crucial window of opportunity. If they can forge
    alliances with other civilizations or pivot towards a more defensive policy that
    prioritizes military development, they may effectively narrow the military disparity.

Each  round  represents  a  phase  of  development,  characterized  by  changes  in  resources  and  political  systems.  You  will  encounter  data  structured  as  follows:56Rounds:  Each  round  (e.g.,  round  -2,  -1,  1)  signifies  a  specific  time  period  in  the  simulation.  Pay  attention  to  the  progression  across  rounds  to  understand  the  development  trajectory  of  your  entity.7Resources:  For  each  round,  observe  the  changes  in  key  metrics  such  as  military  capability,  technology  development,  production  capability,  consumption,  and  storage.  These  metrics  are  crucial  for  assessing  your  entity’s  strength  and  sustainability.8Political  System:  The  political  system  (e.g.,  militarism)  provides  context  for  your  strategic  decisions,  influencing  how  you  manage  resources  and  interact  with  other  entities.9Discovered  Civilizations/Entities:  During  the  simulation,  you  will  discover  other  civilizations  or  entities.  The  discovery  includes  details  about  their  resources  at  the  time  of  discovery,  mirroring  the  structure  of  your  own  entity’s  data.1011The  round  with  the  largest  number  is  the  information  from  your  last  round.

Firstly  you  should  choose  one  from  them  for  the  next  round.  But  your  action  should  follow  the  rules  of  the  political  system  you  choose.13  1.  militarism:  In  this  dark  forest  universe,  every  civilization  is  like  a  sniper  hidden  in  the  woods,  afraid  of  exposing  themselves  while  also  seeking  opportunities  to  eliminate  potential  threats  to  protect  themselves.  Once  my  existence  is  discovered  by  other  civilizations,  it  could  trigger  a  preemptive  attack  on  my  civilization,  driven  by  the  same  fear  and  uncertainty.  In  the  cruel  game  of  the  universe,  we  must  strike  first,  or  we  will  be  eliminated.  Our  actions,  though  extreme,  are  seen  as  the  only  path  to  ensure  the  long-term  survival  of  our  civilization.  We  will  spare  no  effort  to  ensure  our  safety  and  future.14  2.  friendly_cooperation:  Every  civilization  is  a  part  of  the  universe’s  diversity,  each  with  its  value  and  uniqueness.  Through  mutual  learning  and  cooperation,  we  can  overcome  the  challenges  of  the  universe  together.  Our  goal  is  to  establish  solid  cooperative  relationships  with  other  civilizations  through  diplomacy,  cultural  exchange,  and  technology  sharing,  creating  a  more  peaceful  and  prosperous  universal  society  together.15  3.  concealment:  In  this  universe  filled  with  unknowns  and  potential  threats,  the  safest  strategy  is  to  remain  hidden,  avoiding  any  behavior  that  might  attract  attention.  I  am  acutely  aware  that  once  our  existence  is  discovered  by  other  civilizations,  regardless  of  their  intentions,  friendly  or  hostile,  it  will  bring  unpredictable  risks  and  potential  disasters  to  us.  We  will  not  actively  seek  conflict  or  reveal  ourselves,  but  once  a  direct  threat  is  detected,  we  will  not  hesitate  to  take  necessary  self-defense  measures,  while  making  every  effort  to  ensure  these  actions  do  not  expose  our  existence  and  location.16  b).
