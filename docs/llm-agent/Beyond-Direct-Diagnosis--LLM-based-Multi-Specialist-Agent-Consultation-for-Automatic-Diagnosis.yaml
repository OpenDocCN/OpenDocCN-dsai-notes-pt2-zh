- en: Automatic diagnosis is a significant application of AI in healthcare, where
    diagnoses are generated based on the symptom description of patients. Previous
    works have approached this task directly by modeling the relationship between
    the normalized symptoms and all possible diseases. However, in the clinical diagnostic
    process, patients are initially consulted by a general practitioner and, if necessary,
    referred to specialists in specific domains for a more comprehensive evaluation.
    The final diagnosis often emerges from a collaborative consultation among medical
    specialist groups. Recently, large language models have shown impressive capabilities
    in natural language understanding. In this study, we adopt tuning-free LLM-based
    agents as medical practitioners and propose the Agent-derived Multi-Specialist
    Consultation (AMSC) framework to model the diagnosis process in the real world
    by adaptively fusing probability distributions of agents over potential diseases.
    Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our approach compared with
    baselines. Notably, our approach requires significantly less parameter updating
    and training time, enhancing efficiency and practical utility. Furthermore, we
    delve into a novel perspective on the role of implicit symptoms within the context
    of automatic diagnosis.

- en: The utilization of artificial intelligence in healthcare, specifically in the
    realm of automatic diagnosis, has represented a pivotal advancement. Healthcare
    agents towards automatic diagnosis are designed to interact with patients, eliciting
    information about symptom presence and formulating diagnoses based on these patient-reported
    discomforts, termed as complaints. Such AI-driven automatic diagnostic systems
    are poised to assume a critical role in primary healthcare, offering the potential
    to mitigate the challenges posed by medical resource scarcity, particularly in
    economically disadvantaged regions Wang et al. ([2023c](#bib.bib26)); Organization

    consultation platforms, which is depicted in Figure [1](#S1.F1 "Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction
    ‣ Beyond Direct Diagnosis: LLM-based Multi-Specialist Agent Consultation for Automatic
    Diagnosis"). It involves the annotation of dialogue data between the patients
    and practitioners including three distinct components: (1) Explicit Symptoms -
    those symptoms presented in the initial patient complaint; (2) Implicit Symptoms
    - additional symptoms ascertained through subsequent practitioner inquiries; (3)
    Target Disease - the diagnosis predicted by the practitioner, based on a comprehensive
    assessment of symptoms. Previous research predominantly addresses the automatic
    diagnosis task by initially predicting implicit symptoms using explicit symptoms.
    Subsequently, a diagnosis is formulated leveraging all symptoms, employing methodologies
    such as reinforcement learning Tang et al. ([2016](#bib.bib19)); Wei et al. ([2018](#bib.bib27));

    this study introduces the Agent-derived Multi-Specialist Consultation (AMSC) model,
    conceptualized from real-world clinical scenarios. In this model, we envision
    open-source LLMs as primary care physicians, while specialized LLM-based agents,
    each equipped with distinct medical knowledge, function akin to medical specialists.
    These agents, each possessing expertise in different medical domains, generate
    predictive distributions for possible diseases or medical categories without parameter
    updating of LLMs. Subsequently, we propose an adaptive probability distribution
    fusion method that integrates the agent predictions, offering a refined decision-making
    process for disease diagnosis. Additionally, we scrutinize the influence of implicit
    symptoms on automated diagnosis, investigating the impact of various symptoms
    on the diagnostic outcomes.

    Initial work by Tang et al. ([2016](#bib.bib19)) used RL for neural symptom checking,
    followed by hierarchical RL approaches for joint diagnostics and symptom inquiry
    Kao et al. ([2018](#bib.bib10)); Liao et al. ([2020](#bib.bib11)). Wei et al.
    ([2018](#bib.bib27)) introduced a Deep Q-Network for symptom collection, while
    Xu et al. ([2019](#bib.bib29)) emphasized integrating prior medical knowledge
    into policy learning. Further advancements include decoupling symptoms and diseases
    using dense representations Chen et al. ([2023](#bib.bib4)), policy gradient frameworks
    Xia et al. ([2020](#bib.bib28)), multi-level reward models Hou et al. ([2021](#bib.bib6)),

    Chen et al. ([2022](#bib.bib3)) and Hou et al. ([2023](#bib.bib7)) explored sequence
    generation and multi-task frameworks for diagnosis, respectively. Wang et al.
    ([2023c](#bib.bib26)) proposed a joint symptom-disease generation model. However,
    existing research lacks focus on cross-specialist knowledge integration in automatic
    diagnosis. Our study addresses this gap by exploring the fusion of diagnoses with
    agent specialists.

    distribution over a range of potential diagnoses. This process results in the
    formation of a diagnosis distribution matrix when multiple agents are involved.

    the comparative performance of the AMSC framework and the baseline methodologies.
    In terms of diagnostic accuracy, the AMSC framework demonstrates superior efficacy,
    outperforming existing systems on all three datasets, with an enhancement in performance
    of up to 3.2%. Regarding training time, since the LLM is frozen and only the APDF
    module requires training, the AMSC framework exhibits a significant reduction,
    saving up to 95.5% training time compared with the baseline models, equating to
    a mere 0.09 minutes on the DXY dataset. Furthermore, the demand for AMSC for training
    parameters is notably efficient, scaling proportionally with the number of diseases.
    For a dataset encompassing $n$ training parameters, which signifies a reduction
    of up to 99.99% in parameter training. Concerning the mean turn of symptom inquiry,
    the AMSC relies solely on explicit symptoms, obviating the need for implicit symptom
    inquiries. This approach is substantiated by experimental findings, affirming
    the feasibility of an automatic diagnosis framework operating without the integration
    of implicit symptoms.'

    Wang et al. ([2023c](#bib.bib26)) suggests that implicit symptoms could enhance
    the performance of automatic diagnosis systems, which is also intuitive. Therefore,
    we will explore how the implicit symptoms will affect the performance of our AMSC

    (LLMs) in medical diagnostics. In clinical practice, a comprehensive collection
    of symptoms is vital for accurate diagnosis. However, for LLMs, the abundance
    of symptoms, especially without differentiated weighting, poses interpretative
    challenges. Our analysis reveals that 59.1% of symptoms are common across all
    four studied diseases in MuZhi-4, with decreasing proportions for three, two,
    and one disease of 25.8%, 10.6%, and 4.5% respectively. This significant overlap
    complicates the task of accurate diagnosis with LLMs. For example, the symptom
    “cough” is present in 95.8% of bronchitis cases and 53.1% of Upper Respiratory
    Tract Infections (URTI). Furthermore, explicit symptoms, which are primarily patient-reported
    and considered dominant, can effectively reflect a condition of the patient to
    a specialist agent, demonstrating a notable aspect for LLM-based diagnostic systems.

    challenge arises in annotating the symptoms in the dialogues: it necessitates
    the involvement of highly skilled human experts, which renders the process cost-intensive

    natural language descriptions of symptoms. Notably, only the DXY dataset includes
    original self-reported symptom descriptions in natural language. Thus, we apply
    the AMSC to this dataset and compare the efficacy of the AMSC framework on normalized

    an agent-derived multi-specialist consultation framework, designed to assimilate
    and adaptively merge the probability distributions generated by these agent specialists
    in the diagnostic process, mimicking the real-life medical scene of a patient
    with multiple specialists. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach
    not only surpasses existing benchmarks in diagnostic accuracy but also significantly
    reduces the requisite training duration. Additionally, our in-depth analysis sheds
    light on an intriguing facet: the contribution of implicit symptom prediction
    toward diagnostic efficacy may be less substantial than previously anticipated.
    This revelation opens new avenues for exploration in the realm of automated diagnostic
