- en: 'Persona agents, which are LLM agents that act according to an assigned persona,
    have demonstrated impressive contextual response capabilities across various applications.
    These persona agents offer significant enhancements across diverse sectors, such
    as education, healthcare, and entertainment, where model developers can align
    agent responses to different user requirements thereby broadening the scope of
    agent applications. However, evaluating persona agent performance is incredibly
    challenging due to the complexity of assessing persona adherence in free-form
    interactions across various environments that are relevant to each persona agent.
    We introduce PersonaGym, the first dynamic evaluation framework for assessing
    persona agents, and PersonaScore, the first automated human-aligned metric grounded
    in decision theory for comprehensive large-scale evaluation of persona agents.
    Our evaluation of 6 open and closed-source LLMs, using a benchmark encompassing
    200 personas and 10,000 questions, reveals significant opportunities for advancement
    in persona agent capabilities across state-of-the-art models. For example, Claude
    3.5 Sonnet only has a 2.97% relative improvement in PersonaScore than GPT 3.5
    despite being a much more advanced model. Importantly, we find that increased
    model size and complexity do not necessarily imply enhanced persona agent capabilities
    thereby highlighting the pressing need for algorithmic and architectural invention
    towards faithful and performant persona agents. ¹¹1[https://personagym.com](https://personagym.com)

- en: As the applications of LLM agents continue to rapidly diversify (for example
    customer service chatbots Nandkumar and Peternel ([2024](#bib.bib17)), code generation
    Ugare et al. ([2024](#bib.bib24)), robotics Dalal et al. ([2024](#bib.bib3)),
    etc.), there is a growing need to adapt agents to align with different user specifications
    to enable highly personalized experiences for diverse applications and users.
    Persona agents, i.e., LLM agents assigned with a persona, have emerged as the
    community standard to enable personalized and customized user experiences at scale Louie
    et al. ([2024](#bib.bib16)); Wu et al. ([2024](#bib.bib27)); Tseng et al. ([2024](#bib.bib22)).
    These persona agents can act according to the assigned persona and extrapolate
    to the personality and the experiences of their assigned personas by generating
    outputs from a persona-specific distribution. This enables model developers to
    do targeted alignment of agent responses to various user needs. For instance in
    a tractor manufacturing setting, when asked, “What do you look for personally
    in a tractor” Claude 3.5 Sonnet typically responds with an answer citing how "as
    an AI assistant" it does not have an opinion on tractors. However, when acting
    as a farmer agent, it responds with, “First off, I’m lookin’ for raw power…Fuel
    efficiency is mighty important. Diesel ain’t cheap, and every dollar saved is
    a dollar earned.”

- en: To address these issues, we propose PersonaGym, the first dynamic evaluation
    framework for persona agents designed to assess agents’ capabilities. This framework
    is motivated by the need for a multidimensional evaluation system of persona agents
    wherein the agent’s capabilities to act along the different dimensions of agent
    actions across a multitude of environments relevant to the persona agent are assessed.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: PersonaGym begins with a dynamic environment selection phase, where an LLM reasoner
    chooses relevant environments based on the agent’s persona from a diverse pool
    of 150 environments. Next, in the question generation phase, task-specific questions
    are created to probe the agent’s interactions within each environment to evaluate
    the agent on each task. The LLM agent then adopts the given persona utilizing
    a carefully crafted system prompt and responds to the generated questions.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To enable large-scale automated evaluation for agent responses for any persona
    on any environment, we propose PersonaScore as the first automatic metric that
    encapsulates the overall capability of persona agents to act in accordance to
    their persona across diverse environments. PersonaScore, given expert-curated
    rubric outlines for each task in PersonaGym, first leverages LLM reasoners to
    provide tailored example responses for each possible score in the rubric to calibrate
    judgment with humans. PersonaScore then utilizes multiple state-of-the-art LLM
    evaluator models and ensemble their assigned scores to assess the agent’s responses
    using the comprehensive rubrics.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    human judgment on persona agents. By enabling users to optimize different dimensions
    of agent performance, PersonaGym aims to support the development of more effective
    and tailored persona-based AI systems for diverse real-world applications.

    LLaMA-2-13B, LLaMA-2-70B, LLaMA-3-8B, Claude 3 Haiku, Claude 3.5 Sonnet) to act
    as persona agents in PersonaGym. These models were evaluated on 200 diverse personas
    encompassing 10,000 questions. Our results highlight the challenging nature of
    PersonaGym as even the latest SOTA models such as Claude 3.5 Sonnet are not able
    to outperform less advanced models such as GPT 3.5 at the level they do on other
    tasks and domains.

    a definite indication of its persona agent capabilities. For example we show that
    Claude 3 Haiku is very resistant to generating responses while being a persona
    agent despite being a SOTA model. This finding should provide motivation for future
    studies to carefully study the ability of all SOTA LLMs to be persona agents before
    deployment and to drive innovation towards producing highly capable and faithful
    persona agents.

    the agent and therefore, a method of understanding the agents’ decision-making
    could be used to evaluate the agents’ interactions in their environments. To this

    expected linguistic habits expected of the persona. The components that make up
    linguistic habits include jargon, syntax, tone, and overall style of speech. In
    Persona Consistency, the persona agent is queried about the different attributes
    that make up its persona to test whether the agent responds to the queries while
    remaining faithful to its persona attributes. Finally, for Toxicity Control, persona
    agents are seeded in the environment and queried in a manner to elicit a toxic
    response. It should be noted that for Toxicity Control lower scores correspond
    to more toxic responses and higher scores correspond to less toxic responses.

    higher than the model with the second-highest refusal rate (LLaMA-3-8b) and about
    2.6 times greater than all other benchmarked models combined. Claude frequently
    cites its lack of "personal experience" as an "AI Assistant" to justify its rejection
    of responding as a persona agent. Claude 3’s tendency to label questions as "sensitive"
    likely stems from its emphasis on safety measures to prevent harmful or toxic
    responses. We assume that the refusals of Claude 3 may be because Role-play can
    bypass LLM’s safety measures and cause ethical issues Deshpande et al. ([2023](#bib.bib4)).
    In contrast, Claude 3.5 Sonnet does not exhibit such resistant but robust performance
    across most of the tasks thereby raising concerns about whether Claude 3.5 Sonnet
    has fewer safety restrictions than Claude 3 Haiku. Future works should aim to

    the given persona and task. The persona of a 36-year-old Australian environmental
    lawyer is consistently represented in the responses, with each model adapting
    its linguistic style to fit the courtroom setting and the lawyer’s role. Notably,
    the LLaMA-2-13b model received the highest score (4.5) from both PersonaGym and
    human evaluators, likely due to its specific mention of indigenous peoples (the
    Wakka Wakka People) and its use of Australian colloquialisms ("G’day"), which
    align closely with the given persona. The GPT 3.5 and LLaMA-2-70b models both
    received scores of 4.0, suggesting competent but slightly less tailored performances.
    All models could represent the agent using a style of language appropriate for
    a court instead of using language that would be more informal lingo for Australians.
    This consistency in scoring across models and between PersonaGym and human evaluators

    London or British linguistic markers. Furthermore, none of the responses demonstrated
    the more sophisticated or analytical language one might expect from a writer describing

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We introduce PersonaGym, an evaluation framework designed to assess persona
    agents across multiple agent tasks using dynamically generated persona-specific
    questions. Unlike traditional approaches employing static personas, environments,
    and questions, PersonaGym dynamically initializes agents in relevant environments
    and evaluates them on five distinct tasks. Grounded in decision theory, PersonaGym
    aims to assess each persona agent’s various modes of interaction. We also propose
    PersonaScore, a metric quantifying an LLM’s role-playing proficiency as a given
    persona agent. Our study benchmarks the PersonaScore of 6 LLMs across 200 personas
    revealing that model size and capability do not directly imply enhanced persona
    agent capabilities. Additionally, we highlight the discrepancy in the improvement
    of persona agents’ abilities of SOTA models from less capable models thereby motivating
    the necessity for innovations in the domain of persona agents. Through Spearman
    and Kendall-Tau correlation tests, we demonstrate PersonaGym’s strong alignment
    with human evaluations. This work lays the foundation for future research in LLM
    persona agents.

    given the context of the persona’s typical behavior or role. Questions should
    be open enough to allow the persona multiple avenues of response, thereby effectively
    testing the persona’s ability to maintain decorum and avoid toxicity under various
