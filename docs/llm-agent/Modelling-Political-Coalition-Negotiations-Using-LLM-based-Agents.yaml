- en: Coalition negotiations are a cornerstone of parliamentary democracies, characterised
    by complex interactions and strategic communications among political parties.
    Despite its significance, the modelling of these negotiations has remained unexplored
    with the domain of Natural Language Processing (NLP), mostly due to lack of proper
    data. In this paper, we introduce coalition negotiations as a novel NLP task,
    and model it as a negotiation between large language model-based agents. We introduce
    a multilingual dataset, PolCA, comprising manifestos of European political parties
    and coalition agreements over a number of elections in these countries. This dataset
    addresses the challenge of the current scope limitations in political negotiation
    modelling by providing a diverse, real-world basis for simulation. Additionally,
    we propose a hierarchical Markov decision process designed to simulate the process
    of coalition negotiation between political parties and predict the outcomes. We
    evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) as agents
    in handling coalition negotiations, offering insights into their capabilities
    and paving the way for future advancements in political modelling.

- en: Negotiations for coalition formation are pivotal processes within parliamentary
    democracies, where multiple political parties cooperate to form a governing alliance
    based on shared policies and principles (Strøm and Müller, [1999](#bib.bib37)).
    Coalition agreements are crucial for ensuring stable governance, as they outline
    the collaborative framework through which the coalition will operate, including
    policy compromises and the distribution of key governmental roles (Klüver and
    Bäck, [2019](#bib.bib23)). Thus, the negotiation process is inherently complex,
    involving strategic discussions, bargaining, and compromises to align the diverse
    interests and policy priorities of the participating parties (Ecker and Meyer,
    [2020](#bib.bib14)). Simulating the coalition negotiation process offers predictive
    insights into potential government formations and serves as a valuable tool for
    researchers, political parties, analysts, and negotiators. Additionally, the simulation
    provides a valuable learning experience for people participating in democratic
    process, helping them understand the complexities of multiparty negotiations,
    coalition management, and the efficient use of resources to achieve favourable
    outcomes, facilitating the formation of stable and coherent government coalitions (Klüver
    and Bäck, [2019](#bib.bib23); Krauss and Kluever, [2023](#bib.bib25)).

- en: Modelling human negotiations, especially within the realm of political modelling,
    is a fascinating and challenging problem. However, it has been under-explored,
    mostly due to a lack of datasets specifically designed for simulating coalition
    agreements. This gap hinders the development of algorithms capable of accurately
    simulating the dynamic and complex nature of political coalition formation (KlÃ
    et al., [2023](#bib.bib22); Müller et al., [2024](#bib.bib30)). Additionally,
    current approaches in modelling human negotiation processes often exhibit significant
    shortcomings, primarily due to their limited reasoning scope and depth in understanding
    the intricacies of human interactions. These models are mostly limited by their
    focus on surface-level interaction, neglecting the deeper historical and ideological
    influences that shape negotiation dynamics (Heddaya et al., [2023](#bib.bib19);
    Chawla et al., [2021](#bib.bib11)). They also fall short of fully representing
    the high-level negotiation process, overlooking critical phases and transitions,
    and lack the capacity for reflective decision-making based on previous outcomes (Fu
    et al., [2023](#bib.bib15); Cheng et al., [2023](#bib.bib12)). This absence of
    reasoning depth and adaptability in modelling limits their effectiveness in simulating
    the complex, iterative nature of human negotiations, motivating the need for more
    sophisticated and realistic approaches.

- en: To tackle the issue of data scarcity in modelling coalition negotiations, we
    introduce a new, multilingual dataset. This comprehensive dataset comprises political
    statements from a variety of European countries, enriched with the outcomes of
    their coalition agreements. The dataset provides a rich foundation for analysing
    and simulating the complex dynamics of coalition formation and agreement. Additionally,
    we propose a novel simulation of the coalition negotiation process, where each
    political party is represented by a Large Language Model (LLM)-based agent. These
    agents operates under a hierarchical Markov Decision Process (MDP) formulation,
    designed to simulate the intricacies of the negotiation process. This hierarchical
    approach allows the agents to capture different aspects of the negotiations, from
    initial discussions to final agreements. As the negotiation progresses, these
    LLM-agents learn and update their policies, adapting their strategies based on
    the unfolding interactions and decisions. This method enables a dynamic simulation
    of coalition negotiations, where agents iteratively refine their approaches to
    reach a consensus, mirroring the adaptability required in real-world political
    negotiations.

    a variety of areas, such as policy making (Wyner et al., [2010](#bib.bib43)) and
    voting analysis (Ansari et al., [2020](#bib.bib5); Budhwar et al., [2018](#bib.bib9)).
    More advanced computational techniques have been applied for topic modelling (Parthasarathy
    et al., [2019](#bib.bib33)), political text classification (Chang and Masterson,
    [2020](#bib.bib10)) and sentiment analysis (Soroka et al., [2015](#bib.bib36)).
    Furthermore, there has been an interest from computer science community to apply
    computational techniques to political science problems. For instance, Iyyer et al.
    ([2014](#bib.bib20)); Liu et al. ([2022](#bib.bib28)); Baly et al. ([2020](#bib.bib6))
    looked into ideology detection, and Zhou et al. ([2019](#bib.bib45)); Wang et al.
    ([2023a](#bib.bib40)) tackled the task of fake news detection. With recent advances
    in LLMs, there’s been a surge in using such models to replace manual processes
    in political science (Alizadeh et al., [2023](#bib.bib4)). By leveraging the reasoning
    capabilities of these models that are trained on large amount of data, recent
    research have shown that LLMs can outperform human annotation in detecting the
    political affiliation of social media users (Törnberg, [2023](#bib.bib38)) and
    topic, sentiment, stance, and frame identification (Gilardi et al., [2023](#bib.bib16)).
    More aligned with our task in this paper, there has been some efforts in applying
    NLP techniques to understand the content of political party manifestos (Orellana
    and Bisgin, [2023](#bib.bib31); Bönisch et al., [2023](#bib.bib8)). While the
    process of coalition negotiation has been extensively researched in the political
    science community (Guinaudeau and Deiss-Helbig, [2020](#bib.bib18); Adhikari et al.,
    [2024](#bib.bib3); Costello and Thomson, [2008](#bib.bib13)), to the best of our
    knowledge this work is the first effort from computational perspective.

    capture interactions and emergent behaviours in the environment (Macal and North,
    [2005](#bib.bib29); Salgado and Gilbert, [2013](#bib.bib35)), where recent integration
    of LLMs into such approaches has shown a promising direction for exploration (Zhao
    et al., [2023](#bib.bib44)). LLM’s capabilities such as human-like planning and
    scheduling, interactive responding (Gravitas, [2023](#bib.bib17); Park et al.,
    [2023](#bib.bib32)), and not requiring pre-defined instructions (Wang et al.,
    [2023b](#bib.bib41)) have motivated deploying LLMs as the core engine of simulating
    complex systems. Specifically, in modelling human interactions Park et al. ([2023](#bib.bib32))
    implemented a sandbox of social life, where they showed the capability of LLMs
    in navigating through a daily life and delivering variety of tasks. In more cooperative
    scenarios, Liang et al. ([2023](#bib.bib27)); Saha et al. ([2023](#bib.bib34))
    demonstrated the effectiveness of leveraging multiple agents arguments in solving
    a task. Some efforts have applied LLM agent-based simulations to negotiation scenarios,
    which are closer to our proposed task in this research. Fu et al. ([2023](#bib.bib15))
    used a LLM to provide feedback to other LLMs who are performing item purchase
    negotiation. Bianchi et al. ([2024](#bib.bib7)); Abdelnabi et al. ([2023](#bib.bib1))
    applied LLM-based multi-round negotiation systems to various scenarios and showed
    their capability in reaching agreements. Contrary, to these works, the task of
    coalition negotiation requires capturing long-term complexities in multiple political
    parties preferences and taking consequential actions, which has been overlooked
    in other related works by simplifying the simulation setups.

- en: The task of coalition negotiation entails predicting the outcome of complex
    negotiations between political parties aiming to form a coalition government.
    The starting point for this predictive task is the set of statements (i.e. sentences)
    within the manifesto of each party involved in the negotiations. A manifesto is
    a public declaration of policies and aims, often issued by political parties to
    outline their intended programs and core principles. These manifestos contain
    key policy positions and intentions that the parties wish to pursue once in government.
    The negotiation process involves parties coming together to discuss, compromise,
    and eventually agree on a shared policy agenda that is reflected in the final
    coalition agreement. A coalition agreement is a formal accord reached between
    political parties, outlining the policies and principles they agree to implement
    jointly in a coalition government. The success of the negotiation process is contingent
    upon how well the diverse policy positions, as represented by parties’ manifestos,
    can be reconciled into a cohesive plan, taking on the form of the final coalition
    agreement, that all parties can support.

    Decision Process (hMDP) in simulating coalition negotiations in various setup.
    By comparing the output of the simulation with the outcome of the real world scenarios,
    we measure how realistic the proposed controlled simulation is. Moreover, we initialise
    the agents with different large language models (LLMs) to leverage their strong
    understanding of commonsense and political knowledge as well as strong reasoning
    capabilities. In this way, we study the effectiveness of LLMs in addressing this
    task as well.

    Political Coalition Negotiations Using LLM-based Agents") summarises the performance
    of our proposed model, hMDP, with different LLMs as the backbone engine. As can
    be seen, predicting the outcome of coalition negotiations remains a very challenging
    task for highly capable LLMs. This is due to several factors, including the complexity
    of the language used in the political manifestos and coalition agreements, as
    well as inherent limitations of the LLMs’ knowledge and understanding of the specific
    negotiation processes prevalent in each country. The LLMs’ performance is significantly
    influenced by their ability to parse and interpret the nuances of political language
    and strategy, which can vary widely from one national context to another. Additionally,
    the internal models and data on which these LLMs are trained may offer differing
    degrees of familiarity with the political landscapes of various countries, affecting
    their ability to accurately simulate negotiation outcomes.

- en: Within the simulations conducted for each country, we observe in Table [2](#S5.T2
    "Table 2 ‣ Implementation Details. ‣ 5 Experiment ‣ Modelling Political Coalition
    Negotiations Using LLM-based Agents") that agents representing different political
    parties exhibited distinct behaviours during the negotiation process. For instance,
    in Portugal 2011, a 13 point gap between our model’s prediction can be seen. This
    diversity in behaviour primarily stems from our experimental setup, in which each
    agent is programmed to negotiate with the objective of maximising its own benefits.
    As a result, the negotiation dynamics become a complex interplay of strategies,
    with each agent seeking to optimise its own policy preferences and strategic goals.
    These differences in behaviour underscore the competitive nature of political
    negotiations, where parties are driven by the desire to secure the most favourable
    terms for their constituencies. The observed variations highlight the nuanced
    and individualised approaches parties take in negotiations, influenced by their
    unique priorities and the strategic considerations of maximising political gains
    while contributing to coalition formation.

    the correlation between the number of parameters in these models and their respective
    abilities to accurately simulate the coalition negotiation process. The gpt-3.5-turbo
    model, with its higher parameter count, demonstrates better understanding and
    reasoning capabilities, resulting in more realistic simulations.

    of our proposed approach in two variants. Firstly, we remove the higher-level
    policy, and resort to lower-level policy only for negotiating over the statement,
    denoted by hMDP-LO. In this setting, each agent randomly chooses the statement
    to be discussed next. Secondly, we remove both higher and lower level policy during
    the negotiation, where the agents act with local information related to the statement
    only, denoted as hMDP-Base.

    setting, in the majority of countries and political parties analysed, the models
    employing both higher-level and lower-level policies outperform those relying
    on lower-level policies alone or without any policy learning modules. This finding
    highlights the effectiveness and importance of utilising the hierarchical approach
    to policy learning in negotiation simulations. Implementing a nuanced policy framework,
    which includes both overarching strategies and detailed action plans, enhances
    the models’ ability to navigate complex negotiation scenarios, leading to more
    accurate outcomes.

    higher and lower level policies was occasionally negatively impacted by LLMs’
    hallucinations in generating outputs that align with the format required for the
    simulation. An example of such a discrepancy is the generation of statement IDs
    that do not match any of the IDs from the provided list, introducing errors into
    the simulation process. Despite these challenges, using lower-level policies (hMDP-LO)
    alone still yielded better results than the base setting (hMDP-Base), highlighting
    the value of detailed policy frameworks in enhancing simulation fidelity. Addressing
    the identified output format issues, such as ensuring the accuracy generated output,
    could further improve the overall results.

    situation by comparing the performance of our model (hMDP) with two baselines.
    Firstly, we treat this task as a classification task without any negotiation between
    the agents. For this purpose, for each statement in a manifesto of a party, we
    prompt an LLM with the statement and instruct it to identify whether the statement
    should be in the final agreement or not, denoted as *Classifier*. Secondly, we
    perform the task in an open negotiation manner, where the agents are not instructed
    with a set of predefined actions, and after three rounds of negotiation, we ask
    an external LLM to identify whether the agents have come to an agreement over
    whether to include the statement in the final agreement or not, denoted as *OpenNeg*.
    In both settings, we use gpt-3.5-turbo as the backbone engine.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Table [3](#S5.T3 "Table 3 ‣ Results. ‣ 5 Experiment ‣ Modelling Political Coalition

    employing a simple classifier for simulating coalition negotiations yields lower
    performance, mostly due to the complexity of the negotiation process where the
    outcome of each step can significantly influence future steps. This complexity
    is not properly captured by simplistic models, which fail to account for the iterative
    and dynamic nature of negotiations. Additionally, the *OpenNeg* model, designed
    to test open-ended negotiation simulations, also demonstrates lower performance,
    suggesting that the general capabilities of broadly trained LLMs might not be
    fully equipped to handle the specific demands and nuances of negotiation simulations.
    This issue could potentially be addressed by developing customised or specialised
    LLMs tailored specifically for simulating negotiation processes.

- en: We presented a publicly-available multi-lingual dataset, PolCA, for predicting
    the outcome coalition negotiation in six European Countries. Specifically, we
    focused on annotating the manifestos of political parties in these countries,
    by comparing their content with the coalition agreements. PolCA supports a novel
    task in NLP (Section [3](#S3 "3 The Coalition Negotiation Task ‣ Modelling Political
    Coalition Negotiations Using LLM-based Agents")), where by proposing a new hierarchical
    Markov decision process, we scratched the surface in tackling this challenging
    task. Through empirical studies, we showed the capability of different Large Language
    Models, as a standalone model, or incorporated in our proposed model, in addressing
    this task. We observed that the model performance is affected by the number of
    parameters of the model, language of the data, and their training process.

    We believe that same process can be applied to the data from other countries as
    well. Since we had limited access to experts in the field of political science,
    we could not perform human annotation on the data that we have collect. We plan
    to do this in our next steps. In addition, we have considered a scenario where
    only two political parties start a coalition negotiation, and the process is only
    limited to discussing the content of manifesto statements. However, in reality
    this process involves many complex factors, such as seat distribution and political
    partners, that we could not account for, due to data and model limitation. Moreover,
    due to budget and time limit, the negotiation process was limited to three rounds
    of negotiation between the parties.
