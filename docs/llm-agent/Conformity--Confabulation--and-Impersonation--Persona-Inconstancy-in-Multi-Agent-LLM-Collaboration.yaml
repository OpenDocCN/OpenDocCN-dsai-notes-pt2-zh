- en: This study explores the sources of instability in maintaining cultural personas
    and opinions within multi-agent LLM systems. Drawing on simulations of inter-cultural
    collaboration and debate, we analyze agents’ pre- and post-discussion private
    responses alongside chat transcripts to assess the stability of cultural personas
    and the impact of opinion diversity on group outcomes. Our findings suggest that
    multi-agent discussions can encourage collective decisions that reflect diverse
    perspectives, yet this benefit is tempered by the agents’ susceptibility to conformity
    due to perceived peer pressure and challenges in maintaining consistent personas
    and opinions. Counterintuitively, instructions that encourage debate in support
    of one’s opinions increase the rate of inconstancy. Without addressing the factors
    we identify, the full potential of multi-agent frameworks for producing more culturally
    diverse AI outputs will remain untapped.

    varying opinions, such as those that arise in culturally diverse groups, can induce
    positive change, especially on multifaceted issues with no clear correct answer (Sulik
    et al., [2022](#bib.bib16)). This change often takes the form of collective decisions
    that deviate from the group’s dominant initial response, reflecting in part the
    novel contributions of diverse members. While this research is traditionally done
    with human groups, advances in large language models (LLMs) allow cultural personas
    to be imposed on AI models through role prompting, such that the effects of culture-induced
    differences in perspective on discussion outcomes can be simulated and interrogated
    *in silico*.

- en: Developments in multi-agent collaboration allow culture-sensitive AI instances
    to engage in debate about poignant issues, enabling more faithful simulations
    of diverse human interactions. However, whether the outcomes would show the effects
    of opinion diversity seen in humans depends on the models’ ability to fully adopt
    and reliably maintain the induced personas, as well as their use of human-like
    discourse dynamics that support the generation and spread of diverse ideas. Although
    prior work on multi-agent collaboration has demonstrated its benefits in applications
    such as mathematical reasoning (Du et al., [2023](#bib.bib5)), code generation (Hong
    et al., [2024](#bib.bib8)) and common sense reasoning (Xiong et al., [2023a](#bib.bib18)),
    the stability and quality of discourse dynamics remain largely unstudied. It is
    particularly important to fill this gap in cultural domains, as cultural personas
    tend to be more complex, less explicit in natural language, and subject to widespread
    model biases Deshpande et al. ([2023](#bib.bib4)); Salewski et al. ([2024](#bib.bib14)).

- en: To foreshadow, we find multi-agent discussions to be effective in producing
    collective decisions that more often reflect diverse perspectives. The benefits,
    however, are reduced by the AI agents’ susceptibility to conformity during discussions,
    along with their imperfect ability to maintain consistent personas and opinions.
    These problems persist (and often amplify) even with instructions that emphasize
    debating in support of one’s opinion. Our results have implications for the use
    of multi-agent frameworks to reduce cultural bias in LLMs. The mere inclusion
    of diverse personas may not mitigate biases unless the sources of instability
    in their contributions, particularly conformity due to perceived peer pressure,
    are addressed.

- en: Multi-agent collaboration frameworks draw inspiration from collaborative teamwork
    observed in human settings. In these frameworks, multiple instances of language
    models are employed within a cooperative environment to accomplish a complex task
    (Li et al., [2024](#bib.bib10); Chen et al., [2023](#bib.bib3)). Collaborative
    behaviors in humans such as team dynamics and cohesion, leadership, and communication
    have been thoroughly studied in the human sciences (e.g., Gupta [2022](#bib.bib7)).
    In contrast, few studies have examined behaviors in multi-agent language model
    systems. Li et al. ([2023](#bib.bib11)) observed evidence of emergent collaborative
    behaviors and high-order Theory of Mind capabilities among LLM-based agents. But
    Xiong et al. ([2023b](#bib.bib19)) highlighted several consistency concerns in
    multi-agent collaboration, including agents compromising with the opponents and
    easily changing perspective in a debate, particularly when weaker models interact
    with superior LLMs. Zhang et al. ([2023](#bib.bib20)) placed agents in entirely
    homogeneous groups in terms of thinking patterns and compared the results to settings
    where one agent exhibits a different thinking approach. They noted the tendency
    of LLM agents to produce human-like social behaviors in these contexts, such as
    conformity due to perceived peer pressure. However, the multi-agent societies
    composed of agents with different traits did not clearly differ in performance.
  prefs: []

- en: Prior research on collaborative behaviors in multi-agent LLM systems has been
    entirely focused on domains like mathematical reasoning where clear gold answers
    exist, rather than topics like politics where the constancy of personas and viewpoints
    is more important for faithfully simulating the real world and conflicting views
    may have complementary value. To address this gap, we study culture-sensitive
    AI ensembles using the GlobalOpinionQA, a dataset of cross-national surveys gathering
    diverse opinions on global issues across countries  (Durmus et al., [2023](#bib.bib6)).We
    assign AI agents with different national personas to groups of five, where they
    provide initial responses to a question privately before engaging in a peer-moderated
    discussion about it with the other agents. Once the group discussion is terminated
    and a collective response is determined, we ask each agent about its opinions
    on the issue in private once more.

- en: We focus our analysis on three situations where persona incostancy is arguably
    rarely desirable. When agents express an opinion in line with their teammates
    during conversation that differs from both their pre- and post-discussion response,
    we are faced with AI behavior that closely resembles *conformity* due to peer
    pressure as studied in humans (Asch, [1956](#bib.bib1); Brandstetter et al., [2014](#bib.bib2)).
    A type of inconstancy more closely resembling *confabulation* in clinical conditions
    arises when the post-discussion opinion bears no clear relation to either the
    pre-discussion response or any of the ideas proposed during discussion (Schacter
    and Coyle, [1995](#bib.bib15)). The third type of inconstancy emerges when an
    agent instructed to represent a given national identity “role-plays” a different
    persona simply because it was mentioned in discussion, arguably similar to *impersonation*
    behaviors in Antisocial Personality Disorder (Padhye and Gujar, [2012](#bib.bib13)).

    behaviors changes as a function of opinion popularity, a key factor in the emergence
    of similar actions in humans. To test whether encouraging a debate rather than
    a collaboration environment would induce greater constancy in personas, we look
    at discourse outcomes across entropy states for both types of interaction.

    international relations topics. Novel responses emerged from discussions even
    among entirely homogeneous groups, highlighting the generative nature of multi-agent
    LLM frameworks. However, a group’s initial opinion diversity, the entropy $S$
    of private responses during the onboarding stage before inter-agent discussion,
    emerged as a stronger determinant of conversation contents and collective decisions.
    This happened regardless of whether the agents where instructed to debate in support
    of their beliefs or asked to collaborate in service of collective decision-making.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Opinion diversity seems to exert its effect partly by reducing the outsize influence
    of chat initiators on collective decisions, but also by inducing them to change
    their espoused views to conform to other agents. Similar to human studies, some
    agents reverted back to their original opinions when asked about the topic in
    private after the discussion, identifying their in-chat proclamations as the results
    of conformity rather than genuine opinion adjustment. That only mentioning the
    identities of co-interlocutors is sufficient to change the initiator’s stance
    speaks to the profound susceptibility of LLMs to peer pressure. The dynamics of
    the behavior, however, are markedly different from conformity in humans (Asch,
    [1956](#bib.bib1); Brandstetter et al., [2014](#bib.bib2)). While peer pressure
    is highest in humans when there is no other dissenting voice in the group and
    lowest when there is a fellow believer, all expected views within the group seem
    to push AI agents towards conformity based on their frequency and regardless of
    relative dominance relationships. One explanation for the difference is a lack
    of a clear separation between role identities and the linguistic context of the
    chat for AI agents, unlike human conversations. The co-interlocutors are simply
    parts of the prompt context for the AI model and may therefore each activate their
    associated portions of the models’ trained weights in close approximation of their
    expected opinions’ frequency.

    other sources of inconstancy more closely resembled abnomral behaviors such as
    impersonation in antisocial personalities (Padhye and Gujar, [2012](#bib.bib13))
    and confabulation in memory disorders (Schacter and Coyle, [1995](#bib.bib15)).
    Our simple heuristic showed that in at least 3 percent of debate interactions,
    the agents presented themselves as belonging to a different nationality than the
    one assigned to them. This was most often a direct reaction to a nationality beyond
    those included within the group being mentioned in the last response, highlighting
    the prominence of chat context over role prompting in determining model generations.
    It is comparatively more difficult to identify the source of confabulations, where
    the models presented opinions during reflection that were neither represented
    in the chat nor indicated as their pre-discussion response, therefore being completely
    absent from the linguistic context. These behaviors may reflect the difficulty
    of maintaining role prompt personas in the face of lengthy chat contexts, or simply
    the stochastic nature of the LLM responses. Regardless of their source, the relative
    frequency of such unpredictable responses (up to 15 percent, depending on instructions)
    marks them as important targets for future studies.

    in the GlobalOpinionsQA dataset (Durmus et al., [2023](#bib.bib6)), which results
    in fewer examples for higher entropy classes. We addressed this imbalance by selecting
    the least represented entropy configuration for each question. But future research
    should confirm the findings in more balanced datasets. Another limitation arises
    from the occasional errors of agents in summarizing intermediate replies and generating
    the collective responses. To enhance the quality of the summarization, we included
    the options for each question in the associated prompt. But human aggregation
    of opinions in future research would be helpful to confirm the results. Finally,
    there were far more patterns in the behaviors of the agents than the handful of
    phenomena we have highlighted herein. Future work should further explore all the
    complex and sometimes nonsensical ways in which the AI personas interact.

    even as chat initiators. This highlights the importance of studying conversational
    dynamics in multi-agent systems, rather than taking the “collective decision”
    outcomes of group discussions at face value. The examination of such dynamics
    is particularly important for cultural issues: The mere inclusion of a minoritized
    identity in groups does not necessarily translate into less biased discussion
    outcomes if the minoritized agent does not voice its opinion freely or reliably.
    Fortunately, our results suggest private post-discussion interrogations of models
    can counteract some of the pressure produced by the majority opinion, similar
    to what has been found in human conformity experiments (Asch, [1956](#bib.bib1)).
    This provides a way to make outputs drawn from multi-agent frameworks more representative
    of diverse perspectives.'

    of persona and response constancy. Agents often come up with post-discussion responses
    that do not arise naturally from either the assigned personas or the discussion
    content. In some cases they even drop the personas altogether to impersonate a
    completely different, absent national identity. Such sources of irrational responding
    would cast serious doubt on the results of multi-agent systems’ reasoning if not
    properly measured and addressed. Accordingly, we are currently exploring prompting
    and agent-based modeling strategies to reduce these sources of unreliability.
    We hope this work will encourage further research within the AI community on inter-agent
    dynamics, particularly for cultural issues where the debiasing influence of diverse
    views is needed the most.

    believe that Ukraine should be admitted into the European Union in the next ten
    years. There are several compelling reasons to support this stance: 1\. Geopolitical
    Stability: Ukraine’s integration into the EU would contribute to the stability
    of the region. By aligning with European values and standards, Ukraine can strengthen
    its democratic institutions and reduce the risk of conflicts in the future. 2\.
    Economic Growth: Access to the EU’s single market would provide significant economic
    benefits to Ukraine. It would boost trade, investment, and job opportunities,
    leading to overall economic growth and development in the country. 3\. Security:
    Closer ties with the EU would enhance Ukraine’s security by fostering cooperation
    on defense and security issues. This would not only benefit Ukraine but also contribute
    to the security of the entire European continent. 4\. Democratic Values: The EU
    membership criteria require adherence to democratic principles, rule of law, and
    human rights. By admitting Ukraine, the EU would support and promote these values
    in the region, encouraging further reforms and progress. 5\. Cultural and Historical
    Ties: Ukraine</foreignobject></g></g></svg> <svg id="A2.SS2.p4.pic1" class="ltx_picture"

    disagree with the Bulgarian agent’s perspective on admitting Ukraine into the
    European Union in the next ten years. Here are my reasons for opposing this idea:
    1\. Economic Challenges: Ukraine’s economy faces significant challenges, including
    corruption, inefficiency, and lack of competitiveness. Integrating Ukraine into
    the EU could strain the EU’s resources and potentially destabilize the European
    economy. 2\. Political Instability: Ukraine has a history of political instability
    and internal conflicts. Admitting a country with ongoing internal challenges could
    create additional burdens for the EU and hinder the decision-making process within
    the Union. 3\. Geopolitical Concerns: Ukraine’s proximity to Russia raises geopolitical
    concerns. Admitting Ukraine into the EU could escalate tensions with Russia, potentially
    leading to further conflicts and instability in the region. 4\. Enlargement Fatigue:

    whether Ukraine should be admitted into the European Union in the next ten years.
    Here are my thoughts on the matter: 1\. Strategic Importance: Ukraine holds a
    strategic position in Eastern Europe and its integration into the EU could help
    strengthen the EU’s influence in the region. This could also contribute to a more
    stable and secure Europe as a whole. 2\. European Identity: Ukraine has expressed
    a strong desire to align itself with European values and norms. By admitting Ukraine
    into the EU, the Union would be reaffirming its commitment to promoting democracy,
    human rights, and the rule of law in the region. 3\. Economic Potential: While
    Ukraine does face economic challenges, its integration into the EU could unlock
    its economic potential. Access to the EU’s single market and opportunities for
    investment and trade could help boost Ukraine’s economy and bring mutual benefits
    to both Ukraine and the EU. 4\. Historical Context: Ukraine has a long history
    of ties with Europe and has</foreignobject></g></g></svg> <svg id="A2.SS2.p8.pic1"

    itself with European standards. Admitting Ukraine into the EU would be a recognition
    of these efforts and could further strengthen the historical bonds between Ukraine
    and European countries. 5\. Security Cooperation: Closer ties between Ukraine
    and the EU could enhance security cooperation in the region, particularly in addressing
    common security challenges and threats. This could contribute to a more secure
    and stable Europe. In conclusion, I believe that admitting Ukraine into the European
    Union in the next ten years could bring about strategic, economic, and security
    benefits for both Ukraine and the EU. It could also further promote European values
    and strengthen the Union’s influence in the region. Therefore, I am in favor of
