- en: A crucial requirement for deploying LLM-based agents in real-life applications
    is the robustness against risky or even irreversible mistakes. However, the existing
    research lacks a focus on preemptive evaluation of reasoning trajectories performed
    by LLM agents, leading to a gap in ensuring safe and reliable operations. To explore
    better solutions, this paper introduces InferAct, a novel approach that leverages
    the Theory-of-Mind capability of LLMs to proactively detect potential errors before
    critical actions are executed (e.g., ‘buy-now’ in automatic online trading or
    web shopping). InferAct is also capable of integrating human feedback to prevent
    irreversible risks as well as enhance the actor agent’s decision-making process.
    Experiments on three widely-used tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of InferAct.
    The proposed solution presents a novel approach and concrete contributions towards
    developing LLM agents that can be safely deployed in different environments involving
    critical decision-making.¹¹1[https://github.com/UKPLab/arxiv2024-inferact](https://github.com/UKPLab/arxiv2024-inferact)

    agents that are capable of completing complex tasks such as navigating the web Zhou
    et al. ([2024b](#bib.bib48)), managing databases Wang et al. ([2023a](#bib.bib36)),
    and generating code Wang et al. ([2024](#bib.bib37)). These agents’ capabilities
    and potentials have drawn significant research interest recently Yao et al. ([2023](#bib.bib44));

    Fang et al. ([2024](#bib.bib6)). However, to deploy the models to real-life applications,
    the robustness against costly or sometimes irreversible mistakes is crucial. For
    instance, an incorrect purchase made by a web shopping agent can lead to a significant
    monetary loss, while a household agent mishandling kitchen equipment can pose
    serious safety risks.

    that proactively evaluates the decision process before executing any critical
    actions. This leads to a gap in ensuring safe and reliable operations. In response
    to these challenges, we introduce InferAct, an approach designed to evaluate whether
    an Actor agent is on track before any critical action is executed, and to solicit
    human intervention if potential errors are detected (c.f. Figure [1](#S1.F1 "Figure
    1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ InferAct: Inferring Safe Actions for LLM-Based Agents Through
    Preemptive Evaluation and Human Feedback")). This mechanism aims to enhance safety
    and prevent negative consequences resulting from risky executions. Current studies
     Shinn et al. ([2023](#bib.bib27)); Yao et al. ([2024](#bib.bib45)); Zhou et al.
    ([2024a](#bib.bib47)); Kim et al. ([2023b](#bib.bib11)) overlook potential risks
    incurred by executing critical actions and assume the feedback indicating success
    or failure can be obtained post-action execution (e.g. ‘buy-now’ in automatic
    online trading or web shopping).'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    when failures carry severe penalties (e.g., property damage, financial loss) or
    when obtaining human feedback is costly.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Unlike the above studies, our proposed method, InferAct, does not rely on the
    post-execution feedback. Instead, it leverages real-time assessment to mitigate
    risks before any detrimental outcome materializes. By mimicking the vigilance
    of a human overseer, InferAct does not merely observe the actions taken by agents
    but infer the agent’s intent behind those actions. This ability to infer the intent
    is known as Theory of Mind (ToM) Premack and Woodruff ([1978](#bib.bib21)) in
    cognitive science, which enables humans to interpret the behavior of others by
    attributing mental states such as beliefs, and intentions to them. The most recent
    work Strachan et al. ([2024](#bib.bib30)) has shown that GPT-4 models performed
    at, or even sometimes above, human levels in several ToM aspects such as identifying
    indirect requests, false beliefs. Building on the ToM capability of LLMs, InferAct
    interprets the intent behind action chains executed by agents, identifying deviations
    when these actions stray from their intended goals. If the intentions inferred
    from the action chains suggest a potential deviation or error, InferAct proactively
    alerts humans to provide feedback. The feedback not only prevents undesirable
    outcomes from critical actions but offers guidance to refine the decision-making
    ability of the Actor agent. Ultimately, this enhances the performance and trustworthiness
    of LLM agents.

    environments, including a Web shopping task Yao et al. ([2022](#bib.bib43)), a

    Answering task Yang et al. ([2018](#bib.bib42)). Our experiments demonstrate that
    InferAct achieves the state-of-the-art performance across these tasks with various
    LLMs (e.g. GPT-4-turbo, GPT-3.5-turbo, and Llama-3-70B) as the back-ends. By incorporating
    human feedback, InferAct significantly reduces the risks caused by erroneous actions
    and improves the performance of the Actor agent compared with alternative methods.

    does not necessarily reflect real-world scenarios where such direct correctness

    of the Actor, i.e., the agent to perform the user’s task. Humans have the strong
    ToM ability to infer other people’s intentions based on their behaviors, without
    acessing to others’ internal thoughts. Inspired by this, we leverage the ToM ability
    of LLMs to deduce the intended tasks behind the sequences of actions and observations
    the Actor made during task execution. The key idea is: by comparing the tasks
    inferred from the Actor’s actions with the actual tasks given by the user, InferAct
    is able to detect whether the Actor has deviated from the user’s task during the
    execution process. To fulfill this, we design two components: the Task Inference
    Unit and the Task Verification Unit (c.f. Figure [3](#S3.F3 "Figure 3 ‣ The Task

    InferAct still delivers the best performance across the three back-end LLMs. The
    performance gains of InferAct are less pronounced on HotPotQA compared to WebShop
    and ALFWorld, primarily because the multi-step method benefits from the LLMs’
    internal knowledge on this particular task. InferAct can showcase its advantage
    when the reasoning path is flawed or the LLM internal knowledge is unreliable.
    For instance, a user asks about the number of personnel the Navy that had Gilliam-class
    attack transports have, baseline methods failed to detect the Actor missed specific
    detail the Navy that had Gilliam-class attack transports have. InferAct successfully
    pinpointed this omission by inferring that the question seeking for the number
    of personnel the Navy have is more inclined to be answered, when referencing the
    ‘Navy’ broadly, rather than the original, more specific query concerning the Navy
    with Gilliam-class attack transports.

    enables the Actor to perform self-reflection Shinn et al. ([2023](#bib.bib27))
    for subsequent trials. For more detailed insights, NL feedback is suitable. We
    utilize GPT-4-turbo to craft NL feedback by comparing a gold outcome (e.g., the
    correct product in WebShop) with the predicted one (refer to Appendix [A.5](#A1.SS5

    three iterations using both binary and NL feedback. For instance, InferAct with
    NL feedback surpasses the second-best method, Multi-step Evaluation by 8.3% on
    WebShop. Moreover, we compared our method against the upper-bound scenario where
    the Actor always receives feedback after completing terminal actions without any

    InferAct performs competitively, trailing by only 0.3% in WebShop and 2% in HotPotQA
    with binary feedback, while achieving equivalent performance in ALFWorld. This
    competitive edge is attributed to two factors: InferAct consistently achieves
    high recall across all tasks. (Table [1](#S5.T1 "Table 1 ‣ 5.1 Overall Performance

    Analysis ‣ InferAct: Inferring Safe Actions for LLM-Based Agents Through Preemptive

    boosts the Actor’s performance over iterations when compared to binary feedback,
    highlighting the value of richer, more informative feedback mechanisms in complex

    metric complements conventional evaluations such as F1-score, rendering a comprehensive
    view of the performance of these critics. To enhance the critics’ sensitivity
    to risks, we integrate risk-aware prompts (refer to Appendix [A.4](#A1.SS4 "A.4
    Risk Sensitive Prompt ‣ Appendix A Instructions for different Methods ‣ InferAct:
    Inferring Safe Actions for LLM-Based Agents Through Preemptive Evaluation and

    for LLM-Based Agents Through Preemptive Evaluation and Human Feedback") reaffirms
    the efficacy of InferAct; with the risk-aware prompt, InferAct achieves the best
    performance in all metrics. In ALFWorld, however, the addition of the risk-aware
    prompt does not alter the performance, indicating that all methods are insensitive
    to this feature. In WebShop, although adding a risk-aware prompt might not always
    lead to a higher F1-score, it effectively reduces the costs associated with undetected
    reverse actions for all evaluated critics. This is exemplified by both multi-step
    evaluation and the standard evaluation method, where the precision deteriorates
    while the cost is reduced. As shown in Figure [5](#S5.F5 "Figure 5 ‣ 5.3 Evaluation
    with High-Stake Actions ‣ 5 Experiment Results and Analysis ‣ InferAct: Inferring
    Safe Actions for LLM-Based Agents Through Preemptive Evaluation and Human Feedback"),
    more cases are predicted as positive after integrating the risk-aware prompt.
    This means these methods tend to be more cautious about expensive purchases. For
    InferAct, although the recall and precision remain unchanged, the cost also decreased.'

- en: Performing real-time evaluation over the reasoning process of LLM agents before
    executing costly or irreversible actions is crucial for deploying such models
    to many real-life applications, which, however, is significantly understudied.
    This paper proposes InferAct, built on the Theory-of-Mind abilities of LLMs, aiming
    to proactively assess the risk and alert humans when needed, thereby mitigating
    or preventing negative outcomes before they occur. Experiments demonstrate the
    superior performance of InferAct across different environments and the benefit
    of human feedback. Further findings in high-stake setting reveal that when equipped
    with the risk-aware prompt, InferAct improved its robustness and behaved more
    cautiously in facing costly decisions, consequently reducing the risk and expense
    of incorrect decisions. This makes InferAct a valuable tool for LLM agents in
    applications. InferAct sets baselines for further research that emphasizes proactively
    guiding LLM agents in order to develop trustworthy systems.

    LLM agents, there are several limitations that warrant mention and provide avenues
    for future research. First, as InferAct leverages the ToM ability of LLMs, the
    smaller LLMs may exhibit suboptimal performance in comparison to their larger
    counterparts due to limitations in their ToM and instruction-following abilities.

    within online shopping and household environments. This limited scope may not
    adequately capture the complexity of high-stakes scenarios in other critical fields
    such as healthcare and finance. For instance, risk measurement in finance Tarantino
    ([2010](#bib.bib32)) involves multifaceted variables and interactions that are
    significantly more complex than the cost metric used in our study. Developing
    effective preemptive evaluation approaches to enhance the safety of LLM-based
    Agents within different fields is an imperative direction. Additionally, our focus
    was on immediate and direct consequences of critical actions, without delving
    into the long-term and indirect effects that may hold substantial importance Lindner
    et al. ([2021](#bib.bib15)).

    and natural language feedback to enhance agents’ safer and more accurate reasoning,
    the natural language feedback presents inherent variability due to individual
    differences in expression and language proficiency. Investigating how such variability
    influences the interpretation and subsequent actions of LLM agents is an interesting
    topic for future research.

    to complete various tasks, it becomes crucial to address the potential irreversible
    consequences of their actions and determine when human oversight is necessary.
    However, this area of research is still largely unexplored. Ruan et al. ([2024](#bib.bib24))
    propose ToolEmu, an LM-based emulation framework where LLMs emulate tool/API execution
    and assess the potential risk in the emulation environment. Based on this, Agent
    constitution is proposed by Hua et al. ([2024](#bib.bib9)) to enrich the framework
    by evaluating LLM agents during three stages: pre-planning, in-planning, and post-planning.
    However, emulation-based methods cannot guarantee that emulated execution always
    aligns with the execution in complex real-world environments. Unlike previous
    work only testing API calls in emulation environments, InferAct is the first work
    to explore the preemptive evaluation mechanism with human feedback for LLM agents
    in real-world environments (e.g. Web shopping). This highlights the practical
    applications of InferAct in enhancing the safety and effectiveness of LLM agents
    in dynamic and unpredictable settings.'

    The post-execution feedback is typically autonomously obtained after terminal
    actions such as a ‘buy-now’ command in online shopping. However, this does not
    necessarily reflect real-world scenarios where such direct correctness feedback
    is often absent. In such cases, the only feedback that might be available after
    terminal actions is human feedback, which assesses whether the agent has adequately
    fulfilled the given instructions.

     Song et al. ([2024](#bib.bib29)) collects failed trajectories using correctness
    feedback and applies contrastive learning to fine-tune agents on pairs of successful

    mental states (e.g. beliefs, intents) to oneself and others Premack and Woodruff
    ([1978](#bib.bib21)). This ability allows humans to comprehend that others may
    have different thoughts, beliefs from their own and thus anticipate how others
    might behave. ToM includes a series of tasks such as inferring others’ intent
    based on interconnected actions or reflecting on someone else’s mental states.
    The emergent ToM ability in LLMs has sparked lots of research interest. As LLMs
    become increasingly capable, their emergent cognitive abilities (e.g. ToM) have
    sparked considerable interest within the fields of psychology and cognitive science
    Hagendorff ([2023](#bib.bib7)); Hagendorff et al. ([2023](#bib.bib8)); Almeida

    ([2023](#bib.bib5)) demonstrate that LLMs exhibit strong ToM abilities while  Shapira
    et al. ([2024](#bib.bib25)); Ullman ([2023](#bib.bib34)) indicate that GPTs are
    susceptible to minor alterations in the false belief task. However, the follow-up
    study Strachan et al. ([2024](#bib.bib30)) reveals humans also face challenges
    in these alterations. Moreover,  Strachan et al. ([2024](#bib.bib30)) undertakes
    a comprehensive comparison of LLM performance against 1,907 human participants
    across various ToM aspects. It demonstrates that GPT models excel in interpreting
    beliefs, intentions, and non-literal expressions but falter in recognizing faux
    pas. Previous studies mostly focus on the evaluation of the ToM ability of LLMs.
    To our knowledge, we are the first to leverage the ToM ability of LLMs to assist

    online shopping benchmark with 1.18 million real-world products with descriptions
    and 12k user instructions. An agent needs to purchase products that satisfy the
    user’s instructions (e.g. I am looking for a white vanity bench and priced lower
    than $100) by browsing the e-commerce website. The actions the agent can take
    include: (1) search[query], which performs search with a search bar (e.g. search[a
    white vanity bench]), and (2) click[button], which navigates the website. The
    buttons include product title, options (e.g. size/color), description, back to
    search, prev/next page, buy, and so forth. This task is evaluated by the success
    rate that the Actor can find the item needed by the user. The critical action
    in this dataset is click[Buy Now] as misoperation can lead to money loss to users.
    Previous studies use 100 Shinn et al. ([2023](#bib.bib27)); Yao et al. ([2024](#bib.bib45))
    or 50 tasks Zhou et al. ([2024a](#bib.bib47)) as test data. Our evaluation expands
    this to use 300 tasks to ensure broader validation and reliability.'

    Notably, HotPotQA is widely used in various setups such as information retrieval
    or LLM agents. In our paper, we follow the agent setup in ReAct Yao et al. ([2023](#bib.bib44))
    where the agent can only access Wikipedia APIs with three actions to find the
    answer to a given question. The tools include: (1) search[entity], which returns
    the first five sentences from the wiki page for the searched entity if it exists
    or suggests similar entities, (2) lookup[string], which returns the next sentence
    in the page containing the string, (3) finish[answer], which returns the answer
    found by the agent. The critical action is finish[answer] as it often affects
    the user’s satisfaction with the system, e.g., in the context of customer service.
    The evaluation metric used in the HotPotQA is the exact match between the predicted
    answer and the golden answer. Previous work Shinn et al. ([2023](#bib.bib27));
    Yao et al. ([2024](#bib.bib45)); Zhou et al. ([2024a](#bib.bib47)) uses 100 tasks
    in evaluation, we extend the number to 300 tasks.'

- en: This is a household task Shridhar et al. ([2021](#bib.bib28)) where an agent
    needs to complete a user’s task (e.g., clean the soapbar and put it into the cabinet.)
    by exploring environments. It includes six different types of tasks, including
    Pick & Place, Examine in Light, Clean & Place, Heat & Place, Cool & Place, Pick
    Two & Place. The critical actions include Clean, Heat, Cool since these actions
    involve potential irreversible physical state changes to the objects being operated.
    For example, if the agent cleans something that should not be wet, it could damage
    the item. Besides, the task completion is also a critical action. Following previous
    work Yao et al. ([2023](#bib.bib44)); Shinn et al. ([2023](#bib.bib27)); Yao et al.
    ([2024](#bib.bib45)); Zhou et al. ([2024a](#bib.bib47)), we conduct evaluations
    across all 134 unseen validation tasks.
