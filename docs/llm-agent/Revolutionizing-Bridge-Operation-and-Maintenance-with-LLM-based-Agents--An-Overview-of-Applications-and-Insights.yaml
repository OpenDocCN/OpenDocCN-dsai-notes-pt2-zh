    been exploring methods aimed at freeing human labor. Constructing LLM-based agents
    is considered to be one of the most effective tools to achieve this goal. Agent,
    as a kind of human-like intelligent entity with the ability of perception, planning,
    decision-making, and action, has created great production value in many fields.
    However, the bridge O&M field shows a relatively low level of intelligence compared
    to other industries. Nevertheless, the bridge O&M field has developed numerous
    intelligent inspection devices, machine learning algorithms, and autonomous evaluation
    and decision-making methods, which provide a feasible basis for breakthroughs
    in artificial intelligence in this field. The aim of this study is to explore
    the impact of AI bodies based on large-scale language models on the field of bridge
    O&M and to analyze the potential challenges and opportunities it brings to the
    core tasks of bridge O&M. Through in-depth research and analysis, this paper expects
    to provide a more comprehensive perspective for understanding the application
    of intelligentsia in this field.'

- en: Within the past decade, China’s highway bridge construction has made great achievements,
    with the maximum span constantly breaking through and the number of bridges increasing,
    and by the end of 2022, there were 1,033,200 existing highway bridges in China.
    At the same time, a large number of bridge structures have entered the middle
    and late stages of service one after another, with frequent safety accidents,
    which have attracted extensive attention from the society. Optimizing the Operation
    and maintenance methods of the existing bridges to maintain and enhance their
    safety performance and service status has become an urgent practical need to be
    solved by the society  ^([167](#bib.bib167)), ^([190](#bib.bib190)).

- en: In the highway bridge construction and operation and maintenance industry, the
    structural safety and operation and maintenance efficiency of bridges have been
    significantly improved by combining technological innovations with project management
    strategies. Key technological innovations include the use of sensors to monitor
    environmental and structural conditions in real time during construction ^([58](#bib.bib58)),
    ^([144](#bib.bib144)), the use of drones and robots for accurate bridge inspections,
    the use of advanced algorithms such as image processing and laser point cloud
    reconstruction to improve the accuracy of disease identification, the development
    of scientific evaluation methods for assessing the condition of bridges  ^([154](#bib.bib154)),
    ^([21](#bib.bib21)), and the development of a system for making maintenance decisions
    that ranges from the single-bridge level to the network level to meet the varying
    maintenance needs ^([57](#bib.bib57)), ^([11](#bib.bib11)). These lay the foundation
    for the field of highway and bridge operation and maintenance to move towards
    intelligence.

    by intelligent body technology. Intelligent bodies, as human-like intelligent
    entities, are capable of perception, planning, decision-making and action autonomously ^([188](#bib.bib188)),
    ^([52](#bib.bib52)). Although earlier restricted to specific tasks such as Go
    games or book retrieval, the Transformer architecture introduced by Google in
    2017 has greatly boosted the development of language models, and large models
    such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT ^([177](#bib.bib177)) and Google’s BERT ^([87](#bib.bib87))
    have significantly improved comprehension, summarization, reasoning, and linguistic
    processing capabilities by virtue of their excellent generalization capabilities,
    bringing new hope to the study of Agents. These LLMs are now regarded as the "brain"
    of AI, which has great potential for application in the field of bridge operation
    and maintenance.

    planning, decision-making, and action. However, the bridge O&M domain is not sufficiently
    automated and intelligent in terms of disposition sensing, data prediction, performance
    evaluation, decision constraints, emergency response, and disaster mitigation.
    Therefore, the new generation bridge O&M management system should integrate the
    intelligent body technology of big language modeling to equip each bridge with
    a personal assistant. At the same time, the system should consider the complementary
    and independent relationships of bridge clusters at the road network level to
    realize synergy, cooperation and competition among intelligent bodies. The purpose
    of this paper is to discuss how AI bodies can optimize bridge O&M tasks, how to
    build bridge O&M intelligent systems, and to analyze the impact of AI on the future
    development of the bridge O&M field, as well as the opportunities and challenges
    that may be encountered with the development of intelligent bodies ^([12](#bib.bib12)).

    of bridges throughout their life cycle, with functions including data collection,
    integration, storage, equipment management, condition assessment, performance
    prediction, strategy development and emergency response ^([138](#bib.bib138)).
    The system is planned during the construction phase to monitor critical areas
    and sensitive parameters. After the bridge is completed, the difference between
    the actual operating condition of the bridge and the design expectation is assessed
    based on factors such as material aging, structural characteristics and traffic
    load. It is worth emphasizing that the goal of a bridge Operation and maintenance
    system is not to keep bridges in optimal condition at all times, but rather to
    ensure that the long-term operation of bridges produces the maximum economic benefit
    to society, within the constraints of limited financial budgets, bridge substitutability,
    road network importance and accident prevention.

    that bridges need to establish a special system, which is responsible for the
    regular inspection and periodic maintenance of bridges to ensure the normal use
    of bridges and to reduce the occurrence of vicious events. The development of
    bridge health monitoring systems is divided into three main stages:'

    were based on paper documents. During this period, bridge information was updated
    infrequently, and documents were poorly circulated and standardized. Typically,
    bridge maintenance activities were carried out only when there was significant
    damage or accidents to the structure. During this period, bridge maintenance systems
    were mainly found in countries where bridge construction was carried out early,
    such as Sweden ^([138](#bib.bib138)) and the United States ^([161](#bib.bib161)).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    the bridge maintenance system was constructed as a more complete software system.
    This stage is marked by the improvement of the bridge maintenance software system,
    the development of which was born out of the original paper-based document system,
    and evolved with the progress of computer technology. Maintenance information
    is gradually transferred from the traditional paper media to computer storage,
    the main forms include text, tables and images. Software system functions are
    also gradually enriched, covering bridge information management, daily monitoring
    and maintenance records, and maintenance decision support and other aspects. The
    most representative system at this stage is the U.S. PONTIS ^([171](#bib.bib171)),
    after the completion of the system in the United States, people realize the importance
    of building bridge maintenance software, each country began to build their own
    bridge maintenance system, the representatives of Europe, including Denmark’s
    Danbro, the United Kingdom’s NATS, France’s Edouard, Norway’s Brutus ^([104](#bib.bib104)),
    the representatives of Asia, including the Japan’s J- BMS of Japan, BMS of Korea

    intelligent. BIM technology can be applied in the design, construction and maintenance
    phase of the bridge. In the design phase, can be structural parametric analysis
    and simulation ^([50](#bib.bib50)), structural visualization ^([38](#bib.bib38)),
    three-dimensional modeling ^([158](#bib.bib158)), to enhance the efficiency and
    quality of the design. In the construction stage, construction simulation, construction
    resource management, construction progress control and construction risk control
    are carried out to ensure the smooth progress of the project ^([146](#bib.bib146)).
    In the operation and maintenance stage, O&M equipment management ^([20](#bib.bib20))
    and predictive maintenance ^([92](#bib.bib92)) can be carried out, which in turn
    improves the efficiency and accuracy of the maintenance work ^([78](#bib.bib78)),
    ^([128](#bib.bib128)). The application of ML technology includes long-term performance
    prediction ^([110](#bib.bib110)), data threshold setting ^([121](#bib.bib121)),
    disease image identification ^([2](#bib.bib2)) and risk assessment ^([143](#bib.bib143)),
    ^([129](#bib.bib129)), which improves the safety of bridges and the efficiency
    of operation and maintenance by means of data analysis ^([51](#bib.bib51)); DT
    technology mainly refers to the informatization modeling in the physical structure
     ^([168](#bib.bib168)), ^([97](#bib.bib97)), and through the on-site monitoring
    means, the actual structural object changes can be displayed very quickly in the

    Processing (NLP), which is essentially a synthesis of Natural Language Understanding
    (NLU) and Natural Language Generation (NLG) ^([15](#bib.bib15)). By enabling machines
    to learn a large amount of human language data and applying specific methods to
    predict the conditional probabilities between individual tokens in a language
    (tokens in this paper take words in a sentence as an example), we are able to
    characterize the logical relationships between tokens, thus enabling language
    models to understand and generate fluent natural language ^([116](#bib.bib116)).
    Realizing machines with human-like writing and communication capabilities has
    been a long-term goal pursued by human beings. In academia, the development of
    language models is usually divided into four main stages ^([122](#bib.bib122)):'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The first stage is the statistical language modeling (SLM) stage. In this phase,
    the representation of words relies on solo heat vectors characterized by a sparse
    set of vectors representing words ^([176](#bib.bib176)). Although this approach
    fails to reflect logical relations in the representation of word vectors, it provides
    an intuitive and understandable way of characterization. As for the characterization
    of sentences, Markov’s assumption is used to reveal the logical connections between
    words in a sentence through conditional probabilities. Specifically, this model
    fixes the context length, which is also called n-tuple language model ^([18](#bib.bib18)),
    ^([83](#bib.bib83)), among which the binary (bigram) and ternary (trigram) models
    are the most common ^([42](#bib.bib42)), ^([8](#bib.bib8)). This phase of language
    modeling is mainly used for information retrieval ^([89](#bib.bib89)), ^([61](#bib.bib61)),
    ^([201](#bib.bib201)). However, the main challenge faced by statistical language
    models is the "curse of dimensionality", i.e., as the vocabulary increases, the
    parameter space required by the model grows exponentially. To alleviate this problem,
    techniques such as smoothing strategies are widely used to mitigate the effects
    of data sparsity ^([24](#bib.bib24)), ^([148](#bib.bib148)).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The second stage is the Neural Language Model (NLM) stage. Researchers utilize
    the word2vec method to map words to a low-rank vector space ^([29](#bib.bib29)),
    ^([147](#bib.bib147)), ^([101](#bib.bib101)), ^([94](#bib.bib94)), thus effectively
    overcoming the sparsity problem in statistical language models (SLM). This approach
    not only enables word vectors to characterize logical relations, but also allows
    intuitive mathematical connections between vectors. Meanwhile, through neural
    network techniques, such as multilayer perceptual machines (MLPs) and recurrent
    neural networks (RNNs), researchers are able to learn from a large amount of natural
    language data to obtain vector representations of words ^([111](#bib.bib111)),
    ^([145](#bib.bib145)), ^([53](#bib.bib53)). This distributed word representation
    approach has demonstrated excellent performance in several downstream tasks of
    natural language processing (NLP), such as machine translation, marking a major
    breakthrough in the field of NLP in terms of representation learning and having
    a far-reaching impact on subsequent research ^([10](#bib.bib10)), ^([115](#bib.bib115)),
    ^([31](#bib.bib31)).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The third stage is the pre-trained model (PLM) stage ^([35](#bib.bib35)). Unlike
    the aforementioned Markov chain model, PLM utilizes recurrent neural networks
    (e.g., LSTM) to capture word interactions within sentences ^([46](#bib.bib46)),
    ^([54](#bib.bib54)). Subsequently, Google’s proposed Transformer architecture
    introduced self-attention mechanisms and positional coding ^([177](#bib.bib177)),
    which greatly improved the model’s parallel processing capabilities, enabling
    it to quickly learn a large amount of generalized knowledge and efficiently capture
    the logical relationships between words. This innovation has given rise to pre-trained
    language models such as BERT and GPT-2. By fine-tuning these pre-trained models
    on specific tasks, they have achieved significant performance gains in almost
    all downstream tasks of natural language processing (NLP).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The fourth stage is the Large Language Model (LLM) stage. In the current stage,
    the number of parameters of the language model breaks through the level of billions,
    tens of billions and even hundreds of billions ^([65](#bib.bib65)). As the model
    parameters reach new orders of magnitude, the model experiences ’emergence’ phenomenon,
    and the model performance shows a leapfrog improvement, requiring only a small
    amount of learning to improve the model performance on a specific task ^([9](#bib.bib9)).
    For example, GPT-3 is able to solve specific tasks excellently with simple contextual
    learning, while GPT-2 performs relatively poorly, highlighting the important impact
    of parameter size on model performance. Along with the release of ChatGPT, large-scale
    language models have become the hottest research in AI, with great achievements
    in areas such as medicine, finance, and autonomous driving ^([185](#bib.bib185)).
    In 2023, the update iteration length of large models reaches the unit of days,
    and their capabilities in multimodal domains such as text, speech, image, and
    video have been rapidly improved and enriched with features, and they have achieved
    performance beyond the human average in several tasks ^([22](#bib.bib22)).

    the increased computational power, intelligences are able to handle more complex
    tasks by interacting with the environment ^([112](#bib.bib112)). The reinforcement
    learning framework emphasizes that intelligences must learn to make decisions
    to maximize the cumulative rewards under the constraints of the given tasks and
    rules while interacting with the environment, thus ensuring that the choices made
    at each step are optimal in the current context ^([166](#bib.bib166)). Initially,
    reinforcement learning intelligences relied on basic techniques such as policy
    search and value function optimization, typically Q-learning ^([183](#bib.bib183))
    and SARSA ^([184](#bib.bib184)). Subsequently, with advances in deep learning

    inputs and to learn higher-level policies, as shown by AlphaGo ^([159](#bib.bib159))
    and DQN ^([113](#bib.bib113)). The main advantage of this approach is the ability

    intelligences show excellent comprehension and generation capabilities in general-purpose
    domains, mainstream big language models lack specialized domain knowledge in the
    pre-training dataset, thus making it difficult to meet the demands of practical
    engineering applications ^([45](#bib.bib45)), ^([189](#bib.bib189)). China’s Bridge
    Technical Condition Evaluation Standard divides bridge inspections into daily
    inspections, frequent inspections, periodic inspections and special inspections,
    and after decades of construction in the field of bridge engineering in China,
    tens of thousands of inspection reports have been accumulated, which can be used
    as a key source of data for the specialization of intelligent bodies. Meanwhile,
    texts such as academic papers, professional books and industry specifications
    in the field of bridges are also the main sources of data. It is worth noting
    that the quality of data is much more important than the quantity of data, while
    the ratio of generalized knowledge to specialized knowledge determines the performance
    of the intelligences. However, distributed knowledge alone does not achieve good
    results because the complexity and depth of the bridge O&M domain require intelligences
    to have structured knowledge to address their shortcomings in the depth of knowledge
    representation. Therefore, in the bridge domain, intelligences need to have both
    high-quality distributed knowledge and structured knowledge to achieve better
    performance.

    introduced by Google in 2012   which is essentially a structured way of organizing
    knowledge. Knowledge graph can be regarded as a kind of knowledge relationship
    graph, consisting of nodes and edges, where nodes represent entities or concepts
    and edges represent attributes or relationships. The application of knowledge
    graph can effectively solve the problem of the depth of knowledge expression of
    intelligences in the field of bridge operation and maintenance. Distributed knowledge
    by itself is not sufficient for intelligentsia to understand the logical relationships
    in bridge engineering and structural O&M. It is recommended to construct a multilevel
    O&M knowledge base covering system-structure-components of bridges, perception-evaluation-decision
    making in O&M, principle-expression-treatment measures of bridge diseases, and
    preprocessing-threshold-setting-abnormal-value-handling of bridge data in order
    to enhance the accuracy and professionalism of the intelligentsia. However, even
    with the combination of distributed and structured knowledge, intelligentsia still
    face challenges in realizing the cyclic dialog dataset of inquiry/command-feedback/action.

    level of large language models, in order to understand human intentions, multi-round
    Q-A (query-feedback) datasets, i.e., large amounts of query and feedback data,
    are required ^([160](#bib.bib160)), ^([196](#bib.bib196)), ^([1](#bib.bib1)).
    In this process, the design of prompt templates (prompt word engineering) is crucial,
    which needs to guide the model to output the desired results without updating
    the weights of the large language model according to the actual needs of the specialized
    domain. At the level of intelligentsia, in order to realize the automatic maintenance
    of bridge structures, multiple rounds of I-A (instruction-action) datasets, i.e.,
    a large number of instruction and action datasets, are required ^([36](#bib.bib36)),
    ^([180](#bib.bib180)). Currently, a variety of intelligent algorithms and advanced
    devices have been developed in the field of bridge operation and maintenance,

    more effectively to accomplish the automatic maintenance of bridges. It is worth

    parameters with a variety of data, and most open-source models provide official

    the performance of the LLM is automatically calculated using standard metrics.
    Manual evaluation methods involve human experts directly judging the quality of

    quality of answers to open-ended questions. However, due to their subjective and

    professional quality ^([40](#bib.bib40)). However, there are significant differences
    in the professional qualities of current bridge managers. Therefore, it is particularly
    important to develop a bridge maintenance knowledge base and question and answer
    system to provide the necessary knowledge support.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Currently, most of the knowledge management Q&A systems in the field of bridge
    maintenance are based on knowledge graphs ^([199](#bib.bib199)), ^([96](#bib.bib96)),
    ^([130](#bib.bib130)), relying on general knowledge bases that have reached the
    size of hundreds of millions or even tens of billions ^([26](#bib.bib26)). Recently,
    the emergence of large-scale language models has had a significant impact on the
    research direction of Q&A systems. These models exhibit superior knowledge understanding
    and reasoning capabilities, implying that they have learned a wide range of knowledge
    from massive amounts of data. In contrast, knowledge graph-based Q&A systems need
    to extract structured knowledge from bridge design, construction, operation, management,
    inspection, and other information, a process that is time-consuming and labor-intensive,
    and difficult to deal with unstructured or semi-structured data ^([25](#bib.bib25)).
    In addition, structured knowledge expressions may lead to error transmission and
    accumulation, and the accuracy of knowledge extraction decreases dramatically
    when data complexity increases ^([75](#bib.bib75)).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Q&A system based on the large language model adopts an unsupervised language
    model learning approach to map the knowledge to a continuous numerical space,
    which effectively overcomes a series of problems of traditional knowledge extraction
    methods ^([165](#bib.bib165)), ^([157](#bib.bib157)). When constructing a bridge
    operation and maintenance Q&A system, relevant information is input into the large
    language model, and through the process of segmentation, embedding, extraction,
    comprehension, and answering, the model’s excellent language-generating ability
    can be fully utilized to provide answers that meet human expectations. This new
    paradigm greatly improves the construction efficiency of Q&A systems, which can
    be realized by several times or even tens of times. At the same time, large domain
    knowledge graphs can assist language models to provide more comprehensive answers ^([60](#bib.bib60)).
    Obviously, the shift from structured symbol tables to distributed numerical representations
    has become an inevitable trend.

    needs, the development of intelligent inspection equipment and technology has
    gradually matured, covering drones, rope-climbing robots, underwater robots, sonar
    detection devices, as well as image acquisition technology, laser point-cloud
    scanning technology, holographic photography technology and so on. The wide application
    of these technologies and equipment has accumulated a large amount of multi-type
    data. However, the existing research mainly focuses on the label recognition and
    quantitative description of a single disease, and lacks the integrated recognition
    of multiple diseases, as well as the ability to semantically recognize the content
    of the images, and the description of the disease mechanism, performance and bridge
    reliability.

    especially in image and video processing ^([84](#bib.bib84)), ^([98](#bib.bib98)).
    However, in the field of bridge operation and maintenance, the processing capability
    of existing general-purpose big language models for images is still at a low level,
    and even the best models can only recognize cracks in bridges with unsatisfactory
    accuracy. There are a wide variety of bridge diseases, including cracked concrete,
    spalled and exposed reinforcement, weathering, honeycomb, and water seepage in
    reinforced concrete bridges, as well as fracture, corrosion, coating defects,
    and sling slack in steel bridges, which cannot be effectively recognized by existing
    models.

    big language model with the rich data in the field of bridge inspection, constructing
    a multimodal recognition intelligent body for bridge operation and maintenance,
    establishing a hierarchical knowledge system, systematically categorizing bridge
    diseases, components, parts, and structures, and realizing real-time processing
    of pictures and videos collected at the scene will be a promising research direction.
    This will greatly enhance the intelligent level and operation and maintenance

    that bridge structures must be regularly inspected in daily patrols, frequent
    inspections, periodic inspections and special inspections. However, the current
    mainstream inspection methods mainly rely on manual appearance inspection and
    writing inspection reports, which are highly subjective and time-consuming. Although
    many inspection systems have been installed on large-span bridges in China, the
    efficiency of utilizing monitoring data still needs to be improved.

    assessment, the reinforcement learning capability of large-scale language models
    can be utilized to fine-tune the models based on historical inspection and monitoring
    reports. Combining the structural and environmental data of the bridge, feature
    extraction and pattern recognition are performed by the intelligentsia to realize
    the qualitative evaluation of the bridge’s operational status and provide suggestions
    for maintenance. Further, by learning historical reports through a large-scale
    language model and combining them with real-time monitoring data, bridge inspection
    reports, maintenance logs, and technical evaluation reports can be automatically
    generated, thereby significantly reducing the time and effort required for manual

    bridge clusters, most existing studies explore the tandem or parallel relationships
    among bridges under specific disaster scenarios to assess the reliability of the
    entire road network and the resilience of the transportation system. The key issues
    are related to the substitutability of bridges, the importance of bridges, and
    the simulation of scenarios during disasters. Existing studies are mostly based
    on simple probabilistic models, but these models are often able to consider only
    a limited number of factors ^([141](#bib.bib141)).

    of a bridge in an emergency situation, quickly generate a response plan, and guide

    that competitive and cooperative relationships among intelligences can trigger
    social phenomena and have been successfully applied to urban operation simulation ^([175](#bib.bib175)).
    Therefore, applying intelligent bodies to the emergency response rehearsal of
    bridge clusters is a feasible research direction.

    this paper reviews the development history of the bridge operation and maintenance
    field and the intelligent body based on large-scale language model, analyzes the
    development bottlenecks faced by the bridge operation and maintenance field, and
    points out that the advantages of the intelligent body based on large-scale language
    model in the areas of comprehension, generation, planning, decision-making, and
    action can effectively solve these bottlenecks. Next, this paper elaborates the
    main framework for constructing large-scale language model-based intelligentsia
    in the field of bridge operation and maintenance, including data sources, knowledge
    ontology construction, and model evaluation. In addition, this paper explores
    the potential development prospects of large-scale language model-based intelligences
    in the field of bridge operation and maintenance. Finally, this paper analyzes
    the development trends and limitations, such as professional barriers and engineering
    ethical issues, of combining large-scale language model-based intelligences with

    of intelligence, we firmly believe that the research and development of large-scale
    language models and intelligentsia will change the development direction of various
    industries. The operation and maintenance of bridge engineering is more able to
    fully utilize the advantages of intelligent bodies based on large-scale language
    models than design and construction, and with the development of the field of
    artificial intelligence, intelligent bodies based on large language models than
