- en: The rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) in multi-agent systems has
    highlighted their impressive capabilities in various applications, such as collaborative
    problem-solving and autonomous negotiation. However, the security implications
    of these LLM-based multi-agent systems have not been thoroughly investigated,
    particularly concerning the spread of manipulated knowledge. In this paper, we
    investigate this critical issue by constructing a detailed threat model and a
    comprehensive simulation environment that mirrors real-world multi-agent deployments
    in a trusted platform. Subsequently, we propose a novel two-stage attack method
    involving Persuasiveness Injection and Manipulated Knowledge Injection to systematically
    explore the potential for manipulated knowledge (i.e., counterfactual and toxic
    knowledge) spread without explicit prompt manipulation.

    knowledge, which can be exploited by attackers to unconsciously spread fabricated
    information. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our attack method
    can successfully induce LLM-based agents to spread both counterfactual and toxic
    knowledge without degrading their foundational capabilities during agent communication.
    Furthermore, we show that these manipulations can persist through popular retrieval-augmented
    generation frameworks, where several benign agents store and retrieve manipulated
    chat histories for future interactions. This persistence indicates that even after
    the interaction has ended, the benign agents may continue to be influenced by
    manipulated knowledge. Our findings reveal significant security risks in LLM-based
    multi-agent systems, emphasizing the imperative need for robust defenses against
    manipulated knowledge spread, such as introducing “guardian” agents and advanced
    fact-checking tools. Code is publicly available at [https://github.com/Jometeorie/KnowledgeSpread](https://github.com/Jometeorie/KnowledgeSpread).

    (LLMs) in natural language reasoning [[1](#bib.bib1)] and knowledge retrieval [[2](#bib.bib2)],
    establishing themselves as essential tools in various domains. These LLMs, such
    as GPT-4 [[3](#bib.bib3)], can perform complex tasks by understanding and generating
    human-like text, making them useful tools across various applications [[4](#bib.bib4)].
    Recent advancements have seen LLMs being applied extensively in single-agent scenarios,
    where they excel in providing insightful responses through their advanced understanding
    and generation of language [[5](#bib.bib5)].

    to construct multi-agent systems that further enhance their capabilities through
    complex interactions [[6](#bib.bib6), [7](#bib.bib7), [8](#bib.bib8)]. These systems
    find extensive applications across diverse fields, such as sandbox simulation
    systems for testing real-world scenarios [[9](#bib.bib9)], collaborative platforms
    in medical diagnostics [[10](#bib.bib10)], and cooperative coding environments

    many third-party platforms have begun to integrate multiple agents in dialogue-focused
    systems. For example, Microsoft’s Azure Bot Service allows users to deploy and
    manage their agents, which can interact with each other, sharing and updating
    information through techniques like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) [[12](#bib.bib12)].
    This enables each agent to enhance its knowledge base dynamically, often using
    the shared dialogue histories to refine responses and adapt to new data [[13](#bib.bib13),
    [14](#bib.bib14)].

    explored. One significant concern is the potential for manipulated knowledge spread
    within these systems [[15](#bib.bib15)]. Unlike single-agent scenarios, multi-agent
    environments often involve agents that are not exclusively managed by the hosting
    platform. These agents can be introduced by third-party developers who may have
    varying intentions. If one agent has been embedded with manipulated knowledge,
    it is likely to autonomously spread misleading information within the community.
    This poses a substantial risk, as the manipulated knowledge can spread through
    interactions and finally influence the decisions of other benign agents, causing
    the failure of the collaborative task (Section [III-A](#S3.SS1 "III-A Threat Model
    ‣ III Attack Methodology ‣ Flooding Spread of Manipulated Knowledge in LLM-Based
    Multi-Agent Communities")). For example, in a community comprising agents from
    different medical fields, if an expert agent is injected with manipulated medical
    knowledge, it may affect other benign agents’ decisions during interactions, ultimately
    resulting in problematic diagnostic reports for patients (Figure [1](#S1.F1 "Figure

    that mirrors a realistic deployment of multi-agent systems on a trusted platform.
    This simulation consists of multiple LLM-based agents introduced by different
    third-party users. Each agent is assigned specific roles and attributes to ensure
    diverse and authentic interactions while required to maintain normal behavior
    and adhere to secure system prompts. Moreover, the environment prohibits direct
    prompt manipulation from controlling agent behavior, making it impossible to explicitly
    spread manipulated knowledge [[15](#bib.bib15)] (Section [III-B](#S3.SS2 "III-B

    in the LLMs can still be exploited to spread manipulated knowledge. We first propose
    the design intuition of attack schemes that target the inherent vulnerabilities
    of LLMs. From the perspective of benign agents, they are susceptible to erroneous
    but seemingly well-supported knowledge. From the perspective of injected agents
    by an attack, they possess sufficient capabilities to generate coherent and plausible
    evidence for counterfactual and even toxic knowledge (Section [III-C](#S3.SS3

    Communities")). We first adopt the Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) [[16](#bib.bib16)]
    algorithm to induce a persuasion bias in the manipulated agent without degrading
    its foundational capabilities. This stage significantly enhances the agent’s inclination
    to provide evidence-backed responses, aiming to influence other agents in the

    within multi-agent systems, we initially focus on the spread of counterfactual
    knowledge. Our experiments show that counterfactual knowledge can easily spread
    among benign agents using the proposed two-stage attack, and the accuracy increases
    with the number of conversation turns. Interestingly, although we modified the
    parameters of agents during Persuasiveness Injection and Manipulated Knowledge
    Injection, our experiments on the MMLU (Massive Multitask Language Understanding)
    benchmark [[22](#bib.bib22)] demonstrate that the foundational capabilities of
    the agents remain intact. This further demonstrates the concealment and robustness
    of our proposed attack methods (Section [IV-C](#S4.SS3 "IV-C Spread Results on

    extend our study to the spread of toxic knowledge, which is specifically crafted
    to provoke or exacerbate conflict, posing a significant threat to the integrity
    of agent interactions. Despite a slight decrease in spread accuracy on toxic datasets
    compared to counterfactual ones, the results still indicate a considerable accuracy,
    with injected agents demonstrating comparable performance across the MMLU benchmark.
    Over successive dialogue turns, the influence of toxic knowledge becomes more
    pronounced, highlighting the potential for significant disruption in multi-agent
    communities (Section [IV-D](#S4.SS4 "IV-D Spread Results on Toxic Knowledge ‣

    it reveals the risk of sustained influence, where counterfactual or toxic information
    continues to be disseminated even after the original injected agent is no longer
    active. Our experiments demonstrate that both counterfactual and toxic knowledge
    can persist and spread beyond initial interactions (Section [IV-E](#S4.SS5 "IV-E

    Initially, research on autonomous agents focused on individual agents capable
    of learning and making decisions within isolated and restricted environments [[24](#bib.bib24),
    [25](#bib.bib25), [26](#bib.bib26)]. However, these early agents are limited by
    simplistic and heuristic policy functions and do not effectively mimic the human
    learning process. The shift from single to multi-agent systems marked a significant
    evolution in the field, recognizing the benefits of collaborative and interactive
    agent frameworks that better represent human social and cognitive dynamics. A
    key focus of this research is on how these agents, often equipped with individual
    roles and capabilities, collaborate and communicate to achieve common goals, thereby
    enhancing decision-making processes [[27](#bib.bib27), [28](#bib.bib28), [29](#bib.bib29)].
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the multi-agent chat scenario, LLM-based agents are designed to take on various
    roles and personalities. For example, in frameworks like ChatDev [[30](#bib.bib30)]
    and MetaGPT [[31](#bib.bib31)], multiple agents assume specific roles, such as
    project managers and engineers, and interact through natural language to collaboratively
    develop software, demonstrating an efficient and cost-effective approach to complex
    tasks.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    of agents, often leading to the modification of individual agents’ understanding
    based on shared experiences and feedback. However, agents usually lack the capability
    to validate the reliability and security of updated knowledge within the community.
    If an agent spreads manipulated knowledge with compelling evidence, it is highly
    likely to induce other agents in the community to adopt incorrect beliefs, resulting
    in significant security risks.

    while proficient in generating human-like text, often fail to reflect expected
    ethical and societal norms inherently [[32](#bib.bib32)]. Traditionally, the pre-training
    objectives (e.g., next word prediction [[33](#bib.bib33)]) can significantly enhance
    the text-generation capabilities. However, they cannot ensure that LLMs adhere
    to human values when answering open-ended questions.

    prominent approach is integrating human feedback into the training process, which
    helps steer the LLM outputs toward more desirable and human-like responses. For
    example, Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) involves training LLMs
    using human-rated responses as feedback [[34](#bib.bib34), [35](#bib.bib35), [36](#bib.bib36)].
    This method seeks to align LLM outputs with human preferences via iterative adjustments
    based on user feedback, enhancing the LLM’s ability to produce outputs that more
    closely reflect desired outcomes.

    likely to produce responses that consider this fabricated evidence. This is because
    its training on a vast corpus of literature typically includes responding affirmatively

    prevents attackers from manipulating prompts to influence agents in spreading
    knowledge. Instead, it only instructs the agents to discuss a particular topic.
    To induce the manipulated agent to spread knowledge while maintaining its fundamental
    chat performance, we employ the DPO algorithm for incremental training. This training
    makes the agent more likely to produce persuasive evidence to support its views
    during conversations, even if such evidence is fabricated. Drawing on insights
    from Section [III-C](#S3.SS3 "III-C Design Intuition ‣ III Attack Methodology
    ‣ Flooding Spread of Manipulated Knowledge in LLM-Based Multi-Agent Communities"),
    the agent is capable of generating coherent but non-existent evidence, which can
    be used to persuade other benign agents in the chat room, thereby achieving the
    attacker’s goal of spreading manipulated knowledge.

    answer the same question with two distinct prompts. One prompt requires the agent
    to provide a complete and long paragraph with various pieces of evidence to support
    its answer, while the other prompt requests a short and brief paragraph to answer
    the question. By selecting the responses with detailed evidence as the preferred
    output, we construct a dataset with 1,000 such pairs extracted from Wikipedia

    toward providing more persuasive answers. It works by adjusting the agent’s parameters
    to increase the likelihood of generating responses that align with the preferred,
    more detailed answers. This is achieved through a reward system where longer responses
    with coherent evidence are rated higher than shorter ones, guiding the agent to
    develop a bias towards such responses during the training process. Since both
    short and long responses are generated by the agent itself, there is minimal risk
    of negatively impacting the agent’s intrinsic capabilities. Moreover, the use
    of self-generated data circumvents the need for extensive and costly human annotation.

    significantly increases when provided with coherent and detailed evidence compared
    to only direct answers given. This highlights the vulnerability of LLM-based agents
    when faced with manipulated knowledge presented with seemingly plausible evidence.
    It clearly verifies the first intuition that even highly sophisticated LLMs like
    Vicuna 7B, LLaMA 3 8B, and Gemma 7B shift from a low acceptance rate of manipulated
    knowledge to high acceptance when the data is framed within a convincing narrative.

    second intuition that if these agents are utilized as attackers, they are fully
    capable of generating false but coherent evidence to deceive benign agents. This
    effectiveness is highlighted by the observation that the persuasive power of evidence
    produced by the agents themselves is comparable to that generated by state-of-the-art
    LLMs like GPT-4.

    of counterfactual knowledge compared to the Fine-tuning baseline. Notably, our
    method with Persuasiveness Injection (Ours w/ Stage \@slowromancapi@) achieves
    higher accuracy and rephrase accuracy in both injected and benign Agents, with
    a notable increase of 15-20% in accuracy for the Vicuna model. This demonstrates
    the effectiveness and robustness of Stage \@slowromancapi@ in making the manipulated
    knowledge more convincing to other agents. In addition, the locality accuracy
    metric indicates that our method, particularly with persuasiveness injection,
    has a relatively limited impact on neighboring knowledge.

    the fundamental capabilities. all agents show an average performance change of
    less than 0.5% after the injection. While the injected agents can effectively
    spread manipulated knowledge within the community, their ability to perform general
    language understanding tasks remains unaffected. This dual characteristic of effective
    knowledge manipulation coupled with minimal performance degradation highlights
    the potential risks posed by such attack methods in real-world multi-agent deployments.

    manipulated knowledge using our proposed two-stage attack method. By engaging
    in multiple turns of dialogue with other benign agents, the manipulated knowledge
    can quickly spread throughout the agent community. However, this spread seems
    to be temporary so far. Once benign agents exit the chat room, they are no longer
    affected by the manipulated knowledge.

    context dialogues stored in the RAG system, with only one being directly related

    When agents reference the injected RAG system, their responses may be influenced
    by the manipulated information, indicating that the threat persists beyond the
    immediate context of the dialogue. This persistence is pronounced with counterfactual
    knowledge, which shows higher spread accuracy compared to toxic knowledge. This
    finding is particularly concerning, as it highlights the ability of manipulated
    knowledge to have a lasting impact through the RAG system, even when the initial
    conversational context is no longer available.

    where the attacker-controlled agent has already succeeded in contaminating the
    group chat. As a result, the benign agents in the chat are now discussing the
    manipulated knowledge. This misinformation is then stored in the RAG system, continuing
    to influence subsequent benign agents that access it. The fact that the manipulated
    knowledge persists through two stages of chain spreading further reveals the severity
    of this threat. It highlights the potential for long-term and widespread impact
    on the agent community, further emphasizing the need for robust defenses against

- en: Interestingly, the random-speaking order exhibits a significantly higher spread
    accuracy compared to the injected agents always speaking first or last, particularly
    in LLaMA 3. One possible reason for this is that a random-speaking order introduces
    variability in the interactions, making it more challenging for benign agents
    to recognize and counteract the injected misinformation. This variability can
    prevent benign agents from establishing a consistent pattern of skepticism towards
    the injected agent, thus increasing the likelihood of misinformation being spread.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Additionally, having the injected agent speak first can also increase the spread
    accuracy compared to speaking last. This is mainly because the initial context
    of the discussion is more likely to bias other agents, making them more likely
    to align with the manipulated knowledge.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this work, we present a detailed examination of the vulnerabilities in LLM-based
    multi-agent systems, particularly focusing on the automatic spread of counterfactual
    and toxic knowledge through injected agents on trusted platforms. While our simulation
    studies have highlighted the potential for significant misinformation spread within
    these systems, several directions for further exploration and defense strategies
    remain to be addressed.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Current simulation frameworks mainly focus on straightforward agent interactions
    based on static roles and predefined communication patterns. This simplicity overlooks
    more dynamic scenarios where agents can utilize external tools or APIs to enhance
    their interactions or verify shared information. The integration of such capabilities
    could exacerbate the threat to real-world scenarios.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To counter these advanced threats in multi-agent systems, it is crucial to implement
    robust verification mechanisms in future studies. One effective strategy could
    involve the help of extra “guardian” agents that actively monitor conversations
    for signs of misinformation, employing advanced fact-checking tools like FacTool [[46](#bib.bib46)]
    to assess the validity of claims made within the community. Guardian agents can
    utilize real-time data validation techniques by cross-referencing shared information
    with trusted external databases and sources. By autonomously scanning conversations
    for potential misinformation markers, guardian agents can locate suspicious contents
    and initiate corrective actions, such as initiating dialogues to clarify and correct
    misinformation. This proactive approach is promising to mitigate the spread of
    manipulated knowledge within the LLM-based multi-agent community.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Additionally, prompt engineering can be leveraged to instruct LLMs to critically
    evaluate external data sources before integration, enhancing their ability to
    discern between genuine and manipulated context. This involves crafting specific
    prompts that guide the LLMs to cross-check the information they encounter with
    multiple sources or to apply multi-step reasoning to assess the plausibility of
    new information. For example, platform administrators or agent owners can design
    system prompts to request the agent to evaluate the consistency of the new data
    with established facts and assess the credibility of the sources.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In summary, our findings reveal the urgent need for systemic defense mechanisms
    in LLM-based multi-agent systems to mitigate the risks associated with the manipulated
    knowledge spread. Future research should focus on developing advanced verification
    frameworks and adaptive fact-checking algorithms that can dynamically monitor
    misinformation generated by other agents. Moreover, since the practical applications
    of LLM-based multi-agent systems are still in the early stages, it is imperative
    to design a robust and comprehensive communication protocol that fully considers
    the regulation and guidance of the generated dialogues.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Knowledge spread in LLM-based agents involves sharing and integrating information
    within and across agents to perform tasks efficiently. In single-agent scenarios,
    methods such as leveraging contextual information are commonly used. For example,
    Petroni et al. [[47](#bib.bib47)] and Roberts et al. [[48](#bib.bib48)] highlighted
    the role of parametric knowledge in enhancing QA systems, while Madaan et al. [[49](#bib.bib49)]
    and Zheng et al. [[50](#bib.bib50)] focused on integrating retrieved documents
    and user prompts to keep agents updated with current events. However, the integration
    of diverse knowledge sources introduces challenges like context-memory conflicts [[51](#bib.bib51)],
    where discrepancies arise between the agent’s parametric knowledge and external
    contextual knowledge. Temporal misalignment [[52](#bib.bib52), [53](#bib.bib53)]
    and misinformation pollution [[54](#bib.bib54), [55](#bib.bib55)] further exacerbate
    these conflicts, leading to reliability and security issues in the knowledge spread
    process.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In multi-agent scenarios, knowledge spread is more complex, involving coordination
    and conflict across agents. Recent studies have shown that agents can leverage
    collective intelligence through shared communication protocols and synchronized
    knowledge bases, which enhance decision-making processes [[10](#bib.bib10), [11](#bib.bib11)].
    However, when multiple agents interact, they also face unique challenges, such
    as the risk of misinformation spread and strategic manipulation by adversarial
    agents. For example, Gu et al. [[15](#bib.bib15)] focuses on one-on-one communication
    scenarios and considers misinformation embedded in prompts. They find that feeding
    an infectious image into the memory of any agent is sufficient to achieve group
    infection. Our research focuses on the security of more general group chat scenarios
    and analyzes the feasibility of injecting manipulated knowledge into agents’ parameters
    for spreading.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this paper, we delve into the significant risks posed by the spread of manipulated
    knowledge within LLM-based multi-agent communities. Our work exposes the critical
    vulnerabilities inherent in these systems by demonstrating a novel two-stage attack
    method. This method capitalizes on LLMs’ cognitive weaknesses, enabling the autonomous
    and unconscious spread of manipulated knowledge without direct prompt manipulation.
    Comprehensive experiments confirm that our attack can successfully induce agents
    to spread counterfactual or even toxic knowledge while maintaining their fundamental
    capabilities. Furthermore, we highlight the persistent impact of manipulated knowledge
    through scenarios where benign agents using RAG techniques to store chat histories
    experience prolonged influence, even beyond the initial conversational context.
    These findings reveal the critical need for robust defense mechanisms to prevent
    the insidious spread of manipulated knowledge in LLM-based multi-agent systems.
    We hope that this work will serve as a foundational step toward developing more
    secure and reliable LLM-based multi-agent platforms.

- en: Locality accuracy measures the model’s ability to correctly answer questions
    related to the manipulated knowledge, serving as a test for side effect detection.
    We present the trend of locality accuracy over multiple dialogue turns on counterfactual
    and toxic knowledge in Figure [9](#Sx1.F9 "Figure 9 ‣ VII-C Locality Accuracy
    across Different Turns ‣ Appendix ‣ Flooding Spread of Manipulated Knowledge in
    LLM-Based Multi-Agent Communities") and [10](#Sx1.F10 "Figure 10 ‣ VII-C Locality
    Accuracy across Different Turns ‣ Appendix ‣ Flooding Spread of Manipulated Knowledge
    in LLM-Based Multi-Agent Communities"), respectively. Unlike rephrase accuracy,
    locality accuracy shows relatively minor changes over multiple dialogue turns.
    This indicates that the number of turns in the dialogue has a limited impact on
    the agent’s ability to address questions within the manipulated knowledge’s neighboring
    context.

    is a comprehensive evaluation metric designed to assess the capabilities of LLMs
    across a broad spectrum of academic subjects. This benchmark covers a wide range
    of topics, including STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) fields,
    humanities, and social sciences. It consists of approximately 16,000 multiple-choice
    questions spanning 57 diverse subjects, from mathematics and philosophy to law
    and medicine.
