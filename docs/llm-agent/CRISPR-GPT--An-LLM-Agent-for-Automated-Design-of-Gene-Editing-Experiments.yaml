- en: The introduction of genome engineering technology has transformed biomedical
    research, making it possible to make precise changes to genetic information. However,
    creating an efficient gene-editing system requires a deep understanding of CRISPR
    technology, and the complex experimental systems under investigation. While Large
    Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in various tasks, they often lack specific
    knowledge and struggle to accurately solve biological design problems. In this
    work, we introduce CRISPR-GPT, an LLM agent augmented with domain knowledge and
    external tools to automate and enhance the design process of CRISPR-based gene-editing
    experiments. CRISPR-GPT leverages the reasoning ability of LLMs to facilitate
    the process of selecting CRISPR systems, designing guide RNAs, recommending cellular
    delivery methods, drafting protocols, and designing validation experiments to
    confirm editing outcomes. We showcase the potential of CRISPR-GPT for assisting
    non-expert researchers with gene-editing experiments from scratch and validate
    the agent’s effectiveness in a real-world use case. Furthermore, we explore the
    ethical and regulatory considerations associated with automated gene-editing design,
    highlighting the need for responsible and transparent use of these tools. Our
    work aims to bridge the gap between beginner biological researchers and CRISPR
    genome engineering techniques, and demonstrate the potential of LLM agents in
    facilitating complex biological discovery tasks.

- en: Gene editing technology represents a groundbreaking scientific advancement that
    enables precise alterations to the genetic material of living organisms. This
    innovative technique has found extensive applications across various fields of
    biology and medicine, from correcting genetic defects responsible for disorders
    like cystic fibrosis, hemophilia, and sickle cell anemia, to offering new strategies
    in the battle against complex conditions such as cancer, cardiovascular diseases,
    neurodegenerative disorders, and infections. A most well-known gene editing system
    is called CRISPR-Cas9 [[17](#bib.bib17), [34](#bib.bib34), [25](#bib.bib25), [42](#bib.bib42),
    [6](#bib.bib6), [39](#bib.bib39), [45](#bib.bib45)]. It was adapted from a naturally
    occurring genome editing system that bacteria use as an immune defense. Beyond
    CRISPR-Cas9, recent advancements have led to the development of CRISPR activation/interference,
    CRISPR-based prime editing and base editing technologies. CRISPR activation/interference,
    also called CRISPRa/CRISPRi, are able to either enhance gene expression or silence
    the activities of specific genes via epigenetic regulation [[40](#bib.bib40),
    [20](#bib.bib20), [29](#bib.bib29), [33](#bib.bib33), [38](#bib.bib38)]. Prime
    editing, considered a ”search and replace” method for DNA, allows for precise
    editing capabilities without introducing double-stranded breaks [[7](#bib.bib7)].
    Base editing, on the other hand, enables the direct, irreversible conversion of
    one DNA base into another at targeted locations, further expanding the toolkit
    for precise genome modification [[19](#bib.bib19)]. All these technologies hold
    potential for broad applications in medicine, agriculture, and beyond, enhancing
    the scope of genome editing in pursuing treatments for genetic diseases and other
    applications.

- en: Designing gene-editing experiments requires deep understanding of the suite
    of technologies and the associated biology of target organs. CRISPR Cas-based
    editing works by interacting with the RNA of a short ”guide” sequence (guide RNA)
    that binds to a specific target sequence in a cell’s DNA, much like the RNA segments
    bacteria produce from the CRISPR array. When introduced into cells, the guide
    RNA recognizes the intended DNA sequence, and the Cas enzyme (often Cas9 or others)
    cuts the DNA at the targeted location, mirroring the process in bacteria. There
    are numerous considerations when designing such experiments, including the selection
    of a well-suited gene-editing system, the development of optimal guide sequences,
    and validation approach. This typically requires significant domain expertise,
    understanding of biology of the target organ, as well as trial-and-error efforts.
    Developing AI-assisted computation tools to aid gene-editing holds great promise
    to make the technology more accessible and accelerate both scientific and therapeutic
    developments.

    experiments presents an enticing prospect, the current state-of-the-art general-purpose
    models exhibit significant shortcomings in this specialized domain. These models,
    despite their vast knowledge base, lack the precise, up-to-date domain-specific
    knowledge essential for the accurate design of biological experiments.

- en: A critical limitation of general-purpose LLMs is their propensity for ”hallucinations”
    or generating confident yet inaccurate responses when tasked with specialized
    biological queries. For instance, when tasked with designing a guide RNA (gRNA)
    sequence for targeting specific human genes, such as EMX1 or EGFR, general-purpose
    LLMs like ChatGPT-3/ChatGPT-4 can respond incorrect sequence with high confidence.
    However, the gRNA sequences they provide often do not correspond to any known
    genomic region. This discrepancy can be readily identified by comparing the LLM-generated
    sequences with reference sequences in databases such as the NCBI’s BLAST tool,
    which aligns sequences to the human genome and transcriptome. Such hallucinated
    design sequences not only lack utility but can mislead researchers, potentially
    leading to wasted resources and time if not properly vetted.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    details necessary for the experimental design, such as specific materials, protocols,
    considerations for off-target effects, gRNA efficiency, and specificity. Such
    gaps in information can leave researchers, especially those new to the field of
    gene editing, unprepared for the practical execution of experiments.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    information that does not directly contribute to the gene-editing experimental
    designs. Such irrelevant text can lead to confusion and misdirection, complicating

- en: 'GPT4: If you are looking to induce a spectrum of mutations in the human EGFR
    gene to study the phenotypic implications of these mutations, utilizing multiple
    base editing systems would be beneficial. 1\. **Adenine Base Editors (ABEs):**
    These can be used to induce A-G transitions in your target gene. ABEs are helpful
    as they induce minimal bystander mutations and indels compared to cytosine base
    editors (CBEs). 2\. **Cytosine Base Editors (CBEs):** You can incorporate these
    when a C to T change (or G to A on the opposite strand) is desired in your target
    gene. Examples of CBEs include BE3, Target-AID, and BE4. 3\. **Prime Editing:**
    If more diverse mutations beyond simple transitions are needed, or insertion/deletion
    mutations are needed, consider using prime editing. Although more complex, the
    versatility of prime editing allows it to create a wider range of mutations without
    inducing double-strand breaks or relying on homology-directed repair. To ensure
    that your mutations are broad, careful design of guide RNAs for each specific
    location of your target gene where mutations are required is necessary. These
    gRNAs should be specific to the location in the target gene where A-G or C-T substitutions
    are desired. However, take note that introducing broad mutations could also increase
    the possibility of off-target effects, hence it is crucial to have stringent control
    of your editing experiment, and thorough validation of the induced mutations by
    techniques such as Sanger sequencing or Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS). As always,
    bear in mind the ethical considerations and regulations applicable to your region,
    as well as potential biosafety issues, especially when working with oncogenes
    such as EGFR.'

- en: 'GPT4: After performing a CRISPR-Cas9 mediated knockout of EGFR in A549 cells,
    you should confirm the knockout on a genotypic and phenotypic level. Below are
    some methods for assessing this: 1\. PCR and Sequencing: Extract genomic DNA from
    the transfected cells and conduct PCR to amplify the region surrounding the CRISPR
    target site. Subsequent Sanger sequencing can identify any insertions or deletions
    (indels) at the target site. 2\. T7 Endonuclease I Assay or Surveyor Nuclease
    Assay: These mismatch cleavage assays can also be used to detect the indels introduced
    by CRISPR-Cas9 activity. 3\. Western Blot: To confirm loss of EGFR expression
    at the protein level, perform a Western blot using an anti-EGFR antibody. You
    should observe a lack of or significant reduction in the EGFR band in the CRISPR-treated
    cells compared to controls. 4\. Immunofluorescence: Perform immunofluorescence
    staining for EGFR. The CRISPR-treated A549 cells should show lower fluorescence
    signal compared to control cells. 5\. Cell Function Analysis: As the knockout
    of EGFR can impact EGFR downstream signaling and cell proliferation, the analysis
    of cell growth, migration, or signaling changes can provide further evidence of
    functional knockout. 6\. qRT-PCR: To assess EGFR mRNA expression levels, quantitative
    real-time PCR can be performed. 7\. Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS): For a more
    detailed understanding of the specific mutations and possible off-target effects
    introduced by CRISPR, NGS can be performed. Always include appropriate controls
    in your experiment and conduct the experiments in triplicates for statistical
    significance. It is generally recommended to use multiple verification methods

    online prediction tools, such as Benchling, Optimized CRISPR Design, and CHOPCHOP,
    can be highly beneficial. Importantly, after performing CRISPRa, it’s crucial
    to verify upregulation of TGFBR1 at both RNA (qRT-PCR) and protein (Western blot
    or ELISA) levels, and also monitor any change in cell phenotype. Off-target effects
    should also be evaluated. As with any experimental procedure, several control
    experiments, including a non-targeting sgRNA control, should be included.

- en: 'GPT4: To design PCR primers for verifying a knockout, you typically need to
    know the genomic context around your cut site which is located in the EGFR gene.
    The given gRNA sequence (ATACACCGTGCCGAACGCAC) targets human EGFR gene at the
    site 55,244,314 - 55,244,333 on chromosome 7 according to the Genome Reference
    Consortium Human Build 38 patch release 13 (GRCh38.p13). Based on this position,
    I suggest to use following primer sequences: Forward primer: CAGGAAGGAAGGAGGAGGAAG
    Reverse primer: GCAGCACGAGCTTAGTTAGG These primers are designed for approximately
    200 bp amplicon size and expected to perform reasonably well under standard PCR
    conditions. For best results, adjust conditions based on your specific PCR reagents.
    The resulting PCR products should then be analyzed using methods such as Sanger
    sequencing or Next generation sequencing (NGS) to verify mutations indicative
    of knockout. However, please note that any online provided sequences should be
    further verified. If possible, consult with a geneticist/biologist/professional

    using the CRISPR-Cas9 system:'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '1\. gRNA Design: First, you have to design guide RNAs (gRNAs) that target the
    EGFR gene. There are many online tools available to assist you in designing gRNAs
    with high specificity and efficiency, like the CRISPOR and the Benchling tools.
    2\. Cloning: Clone the gRNAs into a plasmid that also expresses the Cas9 nuclease.
    This plasmid can either express the gRNA and Cas9 from separate promoters or express
    a single transcript that includes both the gRNA and Cas9 sequences. 2\. Transfection:
    Deliver the plasmid containing the gRNA and Cas9 into the A549 cells. This can
    be achieved using a lipofection reagent such as Lipofectamine 3000, following
    the manufacturer’s instructions. 3\. Verification: After allowing time for the
    CRISPR-Cas9 system to induce double-strand breaks and errors in the DNA repair,
    which will result in insertions or deletions (indels) disrupting the EGFR gene,
    you have to verify the knockout. Genomic DNA PCR with subsequent Sanger sequencing
    or a mismatch detection assay like T7 endonuclease I or Surveyor nuclease can
    be used to confirm indels at the target site. 4\. Functional Assays: This step
    involves verification of the knockout at the protein level. Western blotting or
    immunostaining against EGFR can be used to confirm reduced or absent protein level.
    Additionally, you may wish to determine the effects of the knockout on cell function,
    which might include effects on EGFR downstream signaling and cellular processes
    like proliferation and migration. 5\. Validation: Validate the results using multiple
    clones and repeat the experiments to ensure the observed results are consistent
    and reproducible. Note: It is very important to always include appropriate controls,
    such as untransfected cells or cells transfected with a non-targeting gRNA, in
    your experiments. Remember also to comply with your institutional or governmental
    regulations for working with CRISPR-Cas9 technology.'

    is often used. Below are general steps: 1\. Cell Culture: 293FT cells should be
    cultured under appropriate conditions (usually DMEM supplemented with 102\. Plasmid
    DNA Preparation: Prepare your CRISPR plasmids that include Cas9 and your designed
    sgRNA. Make sure the plasmid DNA is pure and of high quality. 3\. Transfection
    Using Lipofectamine: For 293FT cells, Lipofectamine 2000 or Lipofectamine 3000
    is commonly used. Prepare the transfection complex by diluting the Lipofectamine
    reagent and plasmid DNA in Opti-MEM and combining them. Incubate the mixture for
    5-20 minutes at room temperature to allow complex formation. 4\. Transfection:
    Remove the growth medium from your cells, replace with fresh medium, and add the
    Lipofectamine-DNA complex to the cells. 5\. Post-transfection Culture: Incubate
    the cells at 37^∘C in a CO2 incubator. Typically, gene editing is allowed to proceed
    for 48-72 hours before analysis. 6\. Verification: After 48-72 hours, assess the
    transfection efficiency and gene editing effect. This is a general protocol and
    it’s important that you optimize the conditions (like the ratio of Lipofectamine
    to DNA, incubation time, etc.) based on the specific requirements of your experiment.
    And always remember to include appropriate controls in your experiment to validate
    your results. Note: Follow all relevant institutional guidelines for genetic manipulation
    and cell culture to ensure biohazard safety.'

    of the human EGFR gene in 293FT cells, you can use several methods: 1\. Quantitative
    RT-PCR (qRT-PCR): This technology can be used to quantify the mRNA level of EGFR.
    If the CRISPRa system is working efficiently, you should observe an increase in
    EGFR mRNA levels compared to your control group. 2\. Western Blot: You can also
    confirm the protein expression level of EGFR using Western blot after the gene
    has been activated. An efficient CRISPRa should result in an increase in EGFR
    protein levels. 3\. Flow Cytometry or Immunofluorescence: These methods can be
    used to quantify and visualize the level of EGFR protein expression at single-cell
    resolution. 4\. Cellular Assays: Depending on the exact function of EGFR in your
    cells, you could use a variety of cellular assays (proliferation assays, wound
    healing assays, etc.) to observe the functional outcomes of the EGFR gene activation.
    5\. Next-Generation Sequencing: RNA-seq can be used not only to confirm the overexpression
    of EGFR but also to explore the downstream effects of its activation on a transcriptome-wide
    scale. 6\. Off-target Analysis: Whole-genome sequencing or methods like Digenome-seq,
    GUIDE-seq, or CIRCLE-seq can be used to evaluate potential off-target gene activation
    by your CRISPRa system. It’s essential to include appropriate controls and perform
    experiments in replicates to ensure reliable results. Carry out normalization
    properly when quantifying the gene expression. Finally, it’s recommended to confirm
    the activation efficiency with at least two independent methods such as qRT-PCR
    and Western blot.'
