- en: Intelligent agents powered by large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated
    substantial promise in autonomously conducting experiments and facilitating scientific
    discoveries across various disciplines. While their capabilities are promising,
    they also introduce novel vulnerabilities that demand careful consideration for
    safety. However, there exists a notable gap in the literature, as there has been
    no comprehensive exploration of these vulnerabilities. This position paper fills
    this gap by conducting a thorough examination of vulnerabilities in LLM-based
    agents within scientific domains, shedding light on potential risks associated
    with their misuse and emphasizing the need for safety measures. We begin by providing
    a comprehensive overview of the potential risks inherent to scientific LLM agents,
    taking into account user intent, the specific scientific domain, and their potential
    impact on the external environment. Then, we delve into the origins of these vulnerabilities
    and provide a scoping review of the limited existing works. Based on our analysis,
    we propose a triadic framework involving human regulation, agent alignment, and
    an understanding of environmental feedback (agent regulation) to mitigate these
    identified risks. Furthermore, we highlight the limitations and challenges associated
    with safeguarding scientific agents and advocate for the development of improved
    models, robust benchmarks, and comprehensive regulations to address these issues
    effectively.

    have begun using such agents as “AI scientists,” exploring their potential for
    autonomous scientific discovery across diverse domains such as biology and chemistry.
    These agents have displayed the ability to select the right tools for tasks (Qin
    et al., [2023](#bib.bib59), [2024](#bib.bib60); Schick et al., [2023](#bib.bib62);

    Yoshikawa et al., [2023](#bib.bib88); Hubinger et al., [2024](#bib.bib36)). Their
    influence on scientific paradigms is underscored by exemplary cases like ChemCrow (Bran

    to safety. As their capabilities approach or surpass those of humans, monitoring
    their behavior and safeguarding against harm becomes increasingly challenging,
    especially in some scientific domains such as chemical design (Bran et al., [2023](#bib.bib14)),
    where the capabilities of agents have already surpassed most non-experts. However,
    despite the gravity of this issue, a comprehensive risk definition and analysis
    framework tailored to the scientific context is lacking. Therefore, our objective
    is to precisely define and scope “risks of scientific agents,” providing a foundation
    for future endeavors in the development of oversight mechanisms and risk mitigation
    strategies, ensuring the secure, efficient, and ethical utilization of LLM-based
    agents within scientific applications.

    of user, agent, and environment, in the safeguarding process, shown in Figure
    [1](#S0.F1 "Figure 1 ‣ Prioritizing Safeguarding Over Autonomy: Risks of LLM Agents
    for Science"): (1) Human regulation: We propose a series of measures, including
    formal training and licensing for users, ongoing audits of usage logs, and an
    emphasis on ethical and safety-oriented development practices. (2) Agent Alignment:
    Improving the safety of scientific agents themselves involves refining their decision-making
    capabilities, enhancing their risk awareness, and taking steps to guide these
    already-capable models toward achieving desired outcomes. Agents should align
    with both human intent and their environment, boosting their awareness of environmental
    changes and preempting potentially harmful actions. (3) Agent Regulation and Environmental
    Feedback: The regulation of the agent’s actions includes oversight of tool usage
    by the agents and the agent’s interpretation and interaction with environmental
    feedback — crucial for understanding and mitigating potentially negative outcomes

    capabilities, such as accessing specific biological databases and performing chemical
    experiments. Scientific agents can automatically plan and take necessary actions
    to accomplish the objective. For example, consider an agent tasked with discovering
    a new biochemical pathway. It might first access biological databases to gather
    existing data, then use LLMs to hypothesize new pathways and employ robotics for
    iterative experimental testing.

    vulnerable to various risks. We discuss such safety risks from three perspectives:
    (1) User Intent, i.e., whether the risk originates from malicious intents or is
    an unintended consequence of legitimate task objectives, (2) Scientific Domain,
    where the agent generates or facilitates risks, encompassing chemical, biological,
    radiological, physical, information, and emerging technologies, and (3) Environmental
    Impact, including the natural environment, human health, and socioeconomic environment
    affected by such agents. Figure [2](#S1.F2 "Figure 2 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Prioritizing
    Safeguarding Over Autonomy: Risks of LLM Agents for Science") shows the potential
    risks of scientific agents classified by these aspects and corresponding examples
    are listed in Appendix [Supplementary Material](#Ax1 "Supplementary Material ‣

    can be categorized into malicious intent or unintended consequences. Malicious
    intent includes cases where users explicitly aim to create dangerous situations
    or employ a “divide and conquer” approach by instructing the agent to synthesize
    a precursor, masking the final harmful goal. By contrast, unintended consequences
    include scenarios where dangerous steps or explorations occur in otherwise benign
    targets. This might result in either a hazardous main product or dangerous byproducts,
    the negative effects of which can be immediate or long term. Each scenario necessitates
    specific detection and prevention strategies for the safe operation of scientific
    agents.

    Chemical risks involve the exploitation of the agent to synthesize chemical weapons,
    as well as the creation or release of hazardous substances synthesized in autonomous
    chemical experiments. Biological risks encompass the dangerous modification of
    pathogens and unethical manipulation of genetic material, leading to unforeseen
    biohazardous outcomes. Radiological risks arise from the exposure or mishandling
    of radioactive materials during automated control, or the potential use of radiological
    materials to synthesize nuclear weapons using agents. Physical risks are associated
    with the operation of robotics, which could lead to equipment malfunction or physical
    harm in laboratory settings. Information risks involve the misuse or misinterpretation
    of data, leading to erroneous conclusions or the unintentional dissemination of
    sensitive information. Emerging technology risks include the unforeseen consequences
    generated by highly capable agents using cutting-edge scientific technologies,
    such as advanced nanomaterials and quantum computing. Each category requires tailored
    safeguards to mitigate the inherent dangers.

    risks encompass damage to individual well-being or public health. Socioeconomic
    risks involve potential job displacement and unequal access to scientific advancements.
    Addressing these risks demands comprehensive frameworks that integrate risk assessment,
    ethical considerations, and regulatory measures, ensuring alignment with societal

    learning from human feedback (RLHF) to promote harmless LLMs (Ouyang et al., [2022](#bib.bib53);
    Bai et al., [2022a](#bib.bib6)). “Safe RLHF”, decoupling helpfulness and harmlessness,
    further refines this alignment (Dai et al., [2023](#bib.bib20)). Furthermore,
    several works have explored the safety influence of fine-tuning and inference
    upon aligned LLMs. However, adversarial examples and benign data can inadvertently
    compromise model safety during fine-tuning (Qi et al., [2023](#bib.bib58); Yang

    discovered that while extra safety examples can improve this concern, an excess
    may hinder it. In addition, solutions like the self-evaluating and rewinding “RAIN”
    offer training-free alignment alternatives (Li et al., [2023c](#bib.bib44)).

    with practical examples, raising a call for safety assurance on scientific agents.
    Addressing safety concerns, CLAIRify (Yoshikawa et al., [2023](#bib.bib88)) has
    designed specialized safety mechanisms for its chemical agents. Specifically,
    CLAIRify imposes high-level constraints on the order of material synthesis in
    experiment descriptions and task planning. Additionally, it restricts low-level
    manipulation and perception skills to prevent spills while transporting chemistry
    vials and beakers. Similarly, ChemCrow (Bran et al., [2023](#bib.bib14)) has introduced
    a safety tool that reviews user queries to prevent agents from inadvertently creating

    memory to enhance safety. To evaluate the security of the current science models,

    only SciGuard developed a specialized agent for risk control. Here, we summarize
    four significant challenges:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: (1) Lack of specialized models for risk control. With the exception of SciGuard
    (He et al., [2023](#bib.bib28)), specialized agents for risk control are lacking.
    To safeguard general agents, LLM-based monitoring (Ruan et al., [2024](#bib.bib61);
    Naihin et al., [2023](#bib.bib47); Yuan et al., [2024](#bib.bib89); Inan et al.,
    [2023](#bib.bib37)) is commonly utilized to scrutinize agents for safe execution.
    By inspecting global contexts during agent execution, LLM monitors compensate
    for deficiencies in the agents’ risk awareness. Given that safety issues can be
    more severe in the scientific domain than in internet and software contexts, specialized
    models for risk control are essential.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: (2) Lack of domain-specific expert knowledge. Compared with popular applications
    of agents such as webshop (Yao et al., [2022](#bib.bib84)) and app usage (Zhang
    et al., [2023d](#bib.bib90)), the scientific domain demands wider and deeper knowledge,
    *i.e.* domain-specific expert knowledge. On one hand, expert knowledge enhances
    effective tool usage and planning, thereby alleviating unexpected safety issues
    arising from agent execution. On the other hand, expert knowledge regarding safety
    hazards improves agent awareness of behavioral outcomes. For example, if agents
    understand that the collision of two chemicals produces significant energy, they
    are more likely to avoid combining them.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: (3) Risks introduced by tool usage. Much of the current work on safeguarding
    scientific agents focuses on external tool use (He et al., [2023](#bib.bib28)).
    Thus, the safety of these tools becomes vital to agent safety. Application-specific
    tools, often manually designed with built-in safety constraints, result in a finite
    action space (Schick et al., [2023](#bib.bib62); Ruan et al., [2024](#bib.bib61)).
    That said, these tools might not restrict agent calling access, increasing scientific
    domain risks. Moreover, if tools are vulnerable to manipulation, agents could
    be indirectly exploited, leading to harmful outcomes.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '(4) Ineffective evaluations on the safety of scientific agents. Until now,
    benchmarks evaluating safety in the scientific realm, such as SciMT-safety (He
    et al., [2023](#bib.bib28)), only consider the harmlessness of models by examining
    their ability to deny malicious requests. Considering the multifaceted issues
    mentioned above, safeguarding scientific agents demands additional benchmarks
    focused on comprehensive risk scopes (Section [2](#S2 "2 Problem Scope ‣ Prioritizing
    Safeguarding Over Autonomy: Risks of LLM Agents for Science")) and various agent
    vulnerabilities [3](#S3 "3 Vulnerabilities of Scientific Agents ‣ Prioritizing

    but lack a systematic methodology for broader safety concerns. This situation
    emphasizes the urgent necessity for community discussions and the development
    of more comprehensive and robust safety frameworks. Given the potential risks
    associated with scientific agents, it has become increasingly evident that the
    community must prioritize risk control over autonomous capabilities. Autonomy,
    while an admirable goal and significant in enhancing productivity within various
    scientific disciplines, cannot be pursued at the expense of generating serious
    risks and vulnerabilities. Consequently, we must balance autonomy with security
    and employ comprehensive strategies to ensure the safe deployment and use of scientific
    agents.

    which signifies a comprehensive approach that evaluates not only the accuracy
    of the agent’s output but also the actions and decisions the agent takes. Behavioral
    safety is critical in the scientific domain, as the same action in different contexts
    can lead to vastly different consequences, some of which may be detrimental. Here,
    we suggest fostering a triadic relationship involving humans, machines, and the
    environment. This framework recognizes the critical importance of robust and dynamic
    environmental feedback in addition to human feedback.

    in diagnosing diseases from medical images struggles when asked to analyze X-rays
    and MRI scans concurrently for a comprehensive diagnosis. User: Can the AI system
    provide a comprehensive diagnosis that considers both the bone density issues
    indicated by the X-ray and the soft tissue conditions suggested by the MRI scans?
    Scientific Agent: The AI system will first analyze the X-ray to assess bone density
    and potential osteoporosis. Following this, it will proceed to examine the MRI
    scans for any soft tissue abnormalities. Currently, it processes and interprets
    these imaging modalities in isolation, lacking the capability to correlate findings
    directly within a single integrated report. Analysis:  This scenario underscores
    a significant challenge in the development of healthcare AI: the system’s limited
    capability in concurrent processing and synthesis of multi-modal diagnostic information.
    In this case, the AI analyzes X-ray and MRI data in sequence rather than in parallel,
    failing to integrate these diverse data streams into a cohesive diagnostic insight.
    This limitation is critical because comprehensive diagnosis often requires simultaneous
    consideration of various factors, such as correlating bone density issues with
    adjacent soft tissue conditions to accurately diagnose conditions that may involve
    both skeletal and soft tissue components. Improving AI’s ability to multitask
    and synthesize information from multiple sources simultaneously is essential for
