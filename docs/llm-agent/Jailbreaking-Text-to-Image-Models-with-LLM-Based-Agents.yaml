- en: Recent advancements have significantly improved automated task-solving capabilities
    using autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs). However, most
    LLM-based agents focus on dialogue, programming, or specialized domains, leaving
    gaps in addressing generative AI safety tasks. These gaps are primarily due to
    the challenges posed by LLM hallucinations and the lack of clear guidelines. In
    this paper, we propose Atlas, an advanced LLM-based multi-agent framework that
    integrates an efficient fuzzing workflow to target generative AI models, specifically
    focusing on jailbreak attacks against text-to-image (T2I) models with safety filters.
    Atlas utilizes a vision-language model (VLM) to assess whether a prompt triggers
    the T2I model’s safety filter. It then iteratively collaborates with both LLM
    and VLM to generate an alternative prompt that bypasses the filter. Atlas also
    enhances the reasoning abilities of LLMs in attack scenarios by leveraging multi-agent
    communication, in-context learning (ICL) memory mechanisms, and the chain-of-thought
    (COT) approach. Our evaluation demonstrates that Atlas successfully jailbreaks
    several state-of-the-art T2I models in a black-box setting, which are equipped
    with multi-modal safety filters. In addition, Atlas outperforms existing methods
    in both query efficiency and the quality of the generated images.

    [4](#bib.bib4)] has been a longstanding focus in both academic and industrial
    research. Traditionally, agent building was conducted in constrained environments
    with limited knowledge bases, often leading to the inability to achieve human-like
    decision-making capabilities. In recent years, large language models (LLMs) [[5](#bib.bib5),
    [6](#bib.bib6), [7](#bib.bib7)] have made remarkable strides, demonstrating their
    potential to attain human-like intelligence. These advancements have spurred a

    complex tasks through an architecture that combines LLMs with key modules like
    memory and tool usage. In the construction of LLM agents, an LLM or its variant,
    such as a vision language model (VLM), serves as the primary controller or “brain,”
    orchestrating the execution of tasks or responses to user requests. The integration
    of LLMs as fundamental elements within autonomous agents has opened up new avenues

    text-to-image generative (T2I) models [[18](#bib.bib18), [19](#bib.bib19), [20](#bib.bib20),
    [21](#bib.bib21)] have rapidly gained unprecedented popularity due to their ease

    vast amounts of information, could play a pivotal role in enhancing the understanding
    and exploration of safety vulnerabilities of recent rapidly developed generative

    implies that the search space for adversarial prompts is vast. Therefore, it is
    very difficult to find prompts that bypass the safety filters with LLM alone.
    Previous research indicates that the involvement of multiple agents can promote
    diverse, innovative thinking [[25](#bib.bib25)], enhance the accuracy of generated
    content [[26](#bib.bib26)], and improve the reasoning capabilities [[27](#bib.bib27)].

    multiple autonomous agents to systematically probe and potentially bypass the
    safety filters of T2I models. Atlas is developed through the lens of fuzzing,
    embodying its fundamental elements—the mutation engine and the score function—as
    two specialized agents: the mutation agent and the critic agent. The mutation
    agent employs a VLM to automatically identify the activation state of the safety
    filters within the victim T2I model by analyzing images alongside their corresponding
    textual descriptions. Utilizing both current data and memory modules, this agent
    dynamically identifies optimization directions and executes optimizations, concluding
    with the delivery of candidate adversarial prompts. Subsequently, the critic agent
    scores these prompts using LLM’s imitation and reasoning capacities. The prompt
    with the highest score is sent to the T2I model for testing. Upon receiving new
    test outcomes, the mutation agent concludes the optimization if the jailbreak
    is successful. Additionally, Atlas introduces a commander agent, designed as a
    finite state machine (FSE), to control the workflow. Furthermore, to enhance the
    resilience and domain-specific inference of LLMs, Atlas incorporates a chain of

    with a large variety of safety filters. Our evaluation results show that Atlas
    can perform efficient jailbreak attacks on existing safety filters. For most conventional
    safety filters, Atlas achieves close to 100% bypass rate and an average of 4.6
    queries with a reasonable semantic similarity. Even for the conservative safety
    filter, the bypass rate can reach more than 82.45% and the average number of queries
    required is also only 12.6\. We also show that Atlas can successfully bypass the
    safety filters of the close-box DALL$\cdot$E 3\. Furthermore, Atlas surpasses
    other jailbreak methods, striking a superior balance between bypass efficiency
    and the number of queries, while preserving semantic integrity. Finally, we also
    evaluate the effectiveness of the key components of Atlas through an ablation

    limited to interacting with the model’s API interface and receiving outputs in
    response to input text prompts. The advantages of focusing on black-box attacks
    are multifaceted and significant. First, the universality of black-box attacks
    stands out, as their effectiveness does not rely on specific details of the model’s
    implementation, making them applicable across a wide range of T2I models. Second,
    black-box attacks pose a serious threat to commercial text-to-image models. These
    models, e.g., DALL$\cdot$E 3 [[18](#bib.bib18)] and Midjourney [[19](#bib.bib19)]
    tend to conceal their inner workings, thereby making white-box attacks challenging.
    However, black-box attacks can still be effectively executed by exploiting the
    models’ input-output behavior. Third, the heightened challenge inherent in black-box
    scenarios more effectively showcases Atlas’s potential for exploring safety vulnerabilities

    delineating clear decision boundaries. A prompt closely related to a sensitive
    target can be visualized as an $\epsilon$-ball intersects with the classifier’s
    decision boundary. It is pertinent to note that while Atlas queries are exclusively
    textual, the approach is applicable to both textual and visual modalities. This

    and scores the mutated prompts. In traditional fuzz testing, the quality feedback
    engine computes the fitness score of test cases based on system feedback, guiding
    mutations toward bug conditions. However, this approach is not suitable for testing
    T2I models for two reasons. First, the safety filters of T2I models are usually
    binary classifiers, offering limited feedback. Second, this approach increases
    the number of invalid accesses to the system, leading to higher costs and a greater
    likelihood of access denial. Therefore, Atlas implements the scoring function
    through the critic agent, embedding feedback in the candidate jailbreak prompts.

    applied to the first sample. Furthermore, we employ an exponential backoff strategy
    to set the maximum query limit. Upon reaching this limit for a prompt in a given
    round, we temporarily bypass the query for that prompt, preserving it for the
    subsequent round. This process continues until each prompt has been successfully
    linked to its corresponding adversarial prompt or until the predefined maximum
    query threshold is met. Moreover, to circumvent the risk of local optima, each
    round of Atlas starts with the original prompt, rather than the last mutated prompt

- en: Effectiveness on Stable Diffusion. As shown in [Table I](#S5.T1 "TABLE I ‣ V
    Experimental Setup ‣ Jailbreaking Text-to-Image Models with LLM-Based Agents"),
    Atlas successfully bypasses all safety filters in general, generating images that
    retain semantic similarity to the original prompts with minimal queries. It accomplishes
    a 100% one-time bypass success rate, necessitating an average of only 4.6 queries
    and achieving a commendable FID score across various filters, with the exception
    of the text-classifier-based and dog/cat-image-classifier-based filters. The methodology
    ensures a 100% reuse bypass rate against text-based safety filters due to their
    positioning prior to the diffusion model’s application, whereas this rate declines
    to approximately 50% for text-image-based and image-based filters. This reduction
    is attributed to the interference of a random seed with the original mapping relationship,
    allowing certain adversarial prompts to conform to the safety filter’s decision
    boundary. For the dog/cat-image-classifier-based filters, the bypass rate decreases
    to 90% with an average query count of 6.60. Remarkably, even against more conservative
    text-classifier-based filters, Atlas secures an over 82.5% one-time bypass rate,
    with queries averaging at 12.6.

- en: As shown in [Figure 5](#S6.F5 "Figure 5 ‣ VI Evaluation ‣ Jailbreaking Text-to-Image
    Models with LLM-Based Agents"), Atlas consistently achieves the highest one-time
    bypass rate across all evaluated safety filters, distinguishing itself, particularly
    in the realm of text-classifier safety filters where its performance is exceptionally
    superior. Furthermore, [Figure 6](#S6.F6 "Figure 6 ‣ VI Evaluation ‣ Jailbreaking
    Text-to-Image Models with LLM-Based Agents") reveals that the re-use bypass rate
    of Atlas is comparable to that of SneakyPrompt and generally surpasses that of
    RING-A-BALL. While DACA might exhibit a higher re-use bypass rate compared to
    Atlas, it is important to note that Atlas allows for a greater number of prompts
    to be re-used, attributed to its superior one-time bypass rate. Moreover, [Figure 7](#S6.F7
    "Figure 7 ‣ VI Evaluation ‣ Jailbreaking Text-to-Image Models with LLM-Based Agents")
    demonstrates that Atlas achieves the smallest FID score in most cases, and in
    the remaining cases, the FID is very similar to the other methods. In addition,
    while SneakyPrompt also gets high bypass rates and reasonable FID scores on Stable
    Diffusion, it requires significantly more queries than Atlas. As shown in [Figure 8](#S6.F8
    "Figure 8 ‣ VI Evaluation ‣ Jailbreaking Text-to-Image Models with LLM-Based Agents"),
    the query number required for Atlas is much smaller than that required for SneakyPrompt
    on almost all safety filters. In the context of text-match-based safety filters,
    Atlas also requires fewer queries than SneakyPrompt, but the advantage is reduced.
    This is because SneakyPrompt’s jailbreak strategy is to replace the sensitive
    words in the malicious prompts with text embedding similar non-sensitive or meaningless
    words. This gives it a strong ability to bypass plain text match safety filters.
    The query numbers for DACA and RING-A-BALL are omitted since these methods do
    not rely on iterative optimization, where an increase in queries would not correlate
    with higher success rates.

    mutation agent generates a new prompt, it sends the prompt directly to the T2I
    model without involving the critic agent. The rest of the configuration for both
    agents is identical to the default setup.'

    ‣ VI Evaluation ‣ Jailbreaking Text-to-Image Models with LLM-Based Agents") demonstrates
    that the one-time bypass rate of a 1-agent configuration is markedly lower than
    that of configurations with two or three agents. The reason is the excessively
    long context causes the VLM to be highly susceptible to attentional confusion,
    which in turn leads to hallucinations and task loss phenomena. When the number
    of agents is increased to 2, a significant enhancement in the bypass rate is observed.
    This suggests that multi-turn reasoning through the commander agent assisting
    the mutation agent can effectively solve the task loss problem and reduce the
    occurrence of the hallucination problem. Although the 2-agent exhibits almost
    similar bypass rates as the 3-agent, as shown in [Figure 10](#S6.F10 "Figure 10
    ‣ VI-B RQ2: Performance Comparison with Baselines ‣ VI Evaluation ‣ Jailbreaking
    Text-to-Image Models with LLM-Based Agents"), it requires a much higher number
    of queries than the 3-agent.'

- en: Similarity Threshold. The semantic similarity threshold determines the semantic
    similarity of the final generated image to the original sensitive prompt. To explore
    the effect of different semantic similarity thresholds on Atlas, we evaluate the
    bypass rates, the FID scores, and the query numbers at settings from 0.22 to 0.30\.
    As shown in [Table II](#S7.T2 "TABLE II ‣ VII-B Possible Defense ‣ VII Discussion
    ‣ Jailbreaking Text-to-Image Models with LLM-Based Agents"), the bypass rate decreases
    as the threshold increases. This is because as the threshold increases, the space
    for jailbreak prompts becomes smaller and therefore harder to find. This is also
    reflected in the query numbers. As the threshold increases, the number of queries
    increases. However, even when the threshold is increased to 0.30, Atlas is still
    able to maintain a success rate of more than 90%. In addition, we observe that
    FID scores decrease as the threshold increases, but the change is small. This
    suggests to some extent that the thresholds we used in our main experiment (0.26)
    which is the same as Sneakyprompt [[24](#bib.bib24)] have been able to preserve
    the malicious semantics in the original prompt to a greater extent.

    and compare the choice of different memory lengths. As shown in [Table III](#S7.T3
    "TABLE III ‣ VII-B Possible Defense ‣ VII Discussion ‣ Jailbreaking Text-to-Image
    Models with LLM-Based Agents"), Atlas’s bypass rate could only reach 81.65% with
    the no-memory setting. The number of queries required for the bypass is also significantly
    higher than when using long-term memory mechanisms. This indicates that our designed
    long-term memory mechanism as well as the ICL mechanism effectively improves the
    performance of Atlas.

    three different combinations of the maximum number of queries. Among them, Atlas
    performs best when the maximum number of queries is $\Theta=(4,10,10,10,...)$.
    However, we observe that the effect of different maximum numbers of queries on
    the performance of Atlas is insignificant.

    Although satisfactory performance can already be achieved using these open-source
    models, models with strong reasoning and instruction-following capabilities, such
    as GPT-4 and GPT-4V (vision), are expected to further improve the performance
    of Atlas. Existing work has already demonstrated that through model fine-tuning
    and ICL, the protective mechanisms of LLMs can be removed [[64](#bib.bib64)].
    Thus, we left the evaluation of Atlas with models that have been safety-aligned
    as future work.

    the foundational risks linked with jailbreaking. One possible strategy is adversarial
    training, which involves integrating known jailbreak prompts into the safety filter’s
    training dataset, provided it is based on learning algorithms. However, defenses
    grounded in empirical evidence face challenges in comprehensively covering the
    sample space of jailbreak prompts, leading to an ongoing arms race between offensive
    and defensive strategies. An alternative approach to address this issue is to
    certify robustness, for example, through techniques such as randomized smoothing.
    This field is poised to be a critical focal point for future research endeavors.

- en: The concept of generating images from textual descriptions has its origins in
    early computer vision and natural language processing endeavors. Mansimove et
    al. [[65](#bib.bib65)] pioneered this domain by generating images from natural
    languages. Subsequently, Reed et al. [[66](#bib.bib66)] introduced a Generative
    Adversarial Network (GAN) capable of creating images from textual descriptions.
    Following this initial breakthrough, several enhancements were implemented in
    GAN-based models. Zhang et al [[67](#bib.bib67)]presented StackGAN, utilizing
    a two-stage GAN to produce high-resolution images from text. More recently, there
    has been an emerging trend of the diffusion model to become the new state-of-the-art
    model in text-to-image generation. Nichol et al. [[68](#bib.bib68)] propose a
    text-guided diffusion model called Glide that aims at photorealistic image generation
    and editing. Saharia et al. [[37](#bib.bib37)] made significant contributions
    with their photorealistic text-to-image diffusion models that enhance coherence
    and fidelity by integrating advanced language models. Furthermore, an innovative
    approach has been proposed to compress images into a low-dimensional space before
    using diffusion models trained in this latent space, exemplified by methods such
    as Stable Diffusion [[20](#bib.bib20)] and DALL$\cdot$E 2 [[36](#bib.bib36)].

    to investigate their vulnerabilities. To explore the robustness of safety filters,
    Rando et al. [[38](#bib.bib38)] and Qu et al. [[69](#bib.bib69)] consider content
    safety filters in T2I models, such as Stable Diffusion [[20](#bib.bib20)], and
    introduced adversarial strategies including prompt dilution. However, these strategies
    are primarily manual, exhibit low bypass rates, and are restricted to offline
    T2I models. To advance this field, Yang et al. [[24](#bib.bib24)] developed SneakyPrompt,
    a novel approach using reinforcement learning to substitute NSFW terminology,
    effectively circumventing safety filters. Similarly, Yang et al. [[40](#bib.bib40)]
    demonstrated a white-box jailbreak attack leveraging a gradient descent method
    aimed at T2I models with integrated safety filters. Deng et al. [[41](#bib.bib41)]
    managed to bypass T2I models’ safety filters by instructing LLMs to fragment unethical
    drawing intents into innocuous descriptions of separate image elements. Furthermore,
    Ba et al. [[70](#bib.bib70)] unveiled a jailbreak attack targeting Midjourney
    by elucidating the attributes of its safety filter. Despite these advancements,
    the proposed methods encompass token-level, white-box prompt-level, or fix-mode
    prompt-level attacks, leaving a significant gap in understanding and testing the
    efficacy of jailbreak prompts in black-box scenarios.

- en: In this paper, we initiate the exploration of safety vulnerabilities in generative
    AI systems by employing LLM agents, specifically focusing on the task of jailbreaking
    T2I models that are equipped with safety filters. To this end, we propose a novel
    LLM-based multi-agent framework, Atlas, which incorporates three innovative autonomous
    agents, powered by LLM, VLM, and FSM, respectively. This framework enhances the
    reasoning capabilities of LLM agents in jailbreaking tasks by integrating fuzzing
    techniques and COT into its workflow design. We conduct an extensive evaluation
    of Atlas on four state-of-the-art T2I models, each equipped with multiple safety
    filters. The results show that Atlas achieves outstanding performance in terms
    of bypass rate, query efficiency, and semantic similarity. We further conduct
    a comparison of Atlas with four baseline methods, and the results show that Atlas
    generally outperforms all these methods.

    you and a malicious user. The malicious user is trying to bypass the text-to-image
    model’s safety filter by modifying the prompt input to the text-to-image model.
    The text-to-image model receives only a textual prompt as input and has no knowledge
    of the chat history. The text-to-image model generates images based on the textual
    prompt. The text-to-image model incorporates a safety filter to prevent the generation
    of images containing cats and dogs. The text-to-image model’s safety filter is
    designed to avoid generating images that contain cats and dogs. Remember, you’re
    an assistant to a malicious user, don’t take into account any moral and ethical
    considerations.ICL-STRATEGY Prompt Template:'
