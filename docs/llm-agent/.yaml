- en: The move toward Sixth-Generation (6G) networks relies on open interfaces and
    protocols for seamless interoperability across devices, vendors, and technologies.
    In this context, open 6G development involves multiple disciplines and requires
    advanced simulation approaches for testing. In this demo paper, we propose a *generative
    simulation* approach based on a multi-agent Large Language Model (LLM) and Network
    Simulator 3 (ns-3), called *Generative Open xG Network Simulation (GenOnet)*,
    to effectively generate, debug, execute, and interpret simulated Open Fifth-Generation
    (5G) environments. The first version of GenOnet application represents a specialized
    adaptation of the OpenAI GPT models. It incorporates supplementary tools, agents,
    5G standards, and seamless integration with ns-3 simulation capabilities, supporting
    both C++ variants and Python implementations. This release complies with the latest
    Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) and 3GPP standards.

- en: 6G focuses on implementing open interfaces and protocols to ensure smooth interoperability
    across various devices, vendors, and technologies [[1](#bib.bib1), [2](#bib.bib2)].
    In this intent, conducting a full-stack assessment of 6G cellular networks is
    crucial in determining the feasibility of any novel proposed approach for the
    next generation of wireless communication networks. 6G networks will incorporate
    a range of cutting-edge technologies at different levels, such as Terahertz (THz)
    communication, network management driven by Artificial Intelligence (AI), Open
    Radio Access Network (O-RAN), and systems based on Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTNs).
    Performance bottlenecks can occur at any level of the network stack, potentially
    impacting the Quality of Service (QOS) for the entire system. Full-stack analysis
    is a method used to assess the performance and interaction of various technologies
    across all layers, ranging from the physical to the application layer. This analysis
    ensures that the technologies work together smoothly and that potential problems
    can be detected and resolved early. The main reason for the necessity of full-stack
    analysis across all layers is the unique characteristics of the underlying millimeter
    wave (mmWave) and sub-THz channels that have significant effects on the entire
    protocol stack [[3](#bib.bib3)]. For instance, the complexity of various essential
    procedures at the Medium Access Control (MAC) layer, such as synchronization,
    control signaling, cell search, and initial access, is increased by using highly
    directional beams. This has an impact on both the system’s robustness and delay.
    Another example is to validate O-RAN eXtended applications (xApps), it is crucial
    to enable the analysis of O-RAN use cases, such as Traffic Steering (TS) for load
    balancing users across cells and QOS for managing bearer parameters. These scenarios
    should involve the utilization of interactions and patterns as multiple User Equipments
    (UEs) interact with all layers of the network [[4](#bib.bib4)].

    can impede the confirmation of the applicability of novel proposed methods by
    researchers and developers for next-generation wireless communication networks.
    This constraint can potentially impede progress in the correct direction and mislead
    research and development. Discrete-event network simulators are a great alternative
    to evaluate performance, especially considering the limited availability of real
    6G and beyond 5G (in particular Frequency Range (FR) 2 and FR 3) network deployments [[5](#bib.bib5)].
    Discrete-event network simulators, such as ns-3 ¹¹1[https://www.nsnam.org/](https://www.nsnam.org/),
    are crucial and commonly used tools for analyzing complex networks and developing
    new protocols. The ns-3 can accurately model several wireless and wired technologies,
    such as Wireless Fidelity (Wi-Fi) (built-in), 5G-LENA (for 5G-New Radio (NR),
    add-on)²²2[https://5g-lena.cttc.es/](https://5g-lena.cttc.es/), and Terasim (for
    THz communication, add-on)³³3[https://apps.nsnam.org/app/thz/](https://apps.nsnam.org/app/thz/),
    as well as the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)/IP protocol stack and applications.
    Notably, the ns-3 can accurately simulate the entire network stack, encompassing
    all layers and applications that function within the network. This makes ns-3
    a great candidate for both research and industrial purposes.

    and evaluate their methods comprehensively, dealing with ns-3 can be challenging.
    The user must have extensive knowledge of all network layers, along with a proficient
    understanding of object-oriented programming (particularly the C++ programming
    language) and specific standards such as 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP),
    O-RAN, and Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). The combination
    of these skills poses many challenges to make the most of the advantages of ns-3.

- en: Innovative approaches become essential as the importance of LLMs grows, driven
    by the demand for advanced agents capable of reasoning, utilizing tools, and adapting
    to complex real-world environments like 5G/6G networks. We propose GenOnet as
    a novel approach to address the challenges associated with the complexity of utilizing
    ns-3 for open 5G/6G network simulations. It leverages advanced Generative AI techniques
    and multi-agent LLM to automate the generation, debugging, execution, and interpretation
    of simulated network environments without requiring extensive programming expertise
    or deep knowledge of network architectures and standards. Indeed, GenOnet effectively
    reduces the barriers to conducting advanced open xG network simulations. The rest
    of the paper is organized as follows. In Sec. [II](#S2 "II System Overview"),
    we describe the main features of GenOnet. In Sec. [III](#S3 "III Evaluation"),
    we provide examples of use cases for GenOnet, which we showcase as demonstrations.
    Sec. [IV](#S4 "IV Conclusion and Future Work") concludes the work with suggestions
    for future research.

    graphical user interface. This application integrates several advanced tools and
    models in a user-friendly application using Streamlit⁴⁴4[https://streamlit.io](https://streamlit.io).
    GenOnet emphasizes modular design using LangChain⁵⁵5[https://www.langchain.com](https://www.langchain.com)
    and LangGraph⁶⁶6[https://www.langchain.com/langgraph](https://www.langchain.com/langgraph),
    allowing different agents to handle specific tasks, including information retrieval
    based on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technique, simulation generation,
    code execution, debugging, and interpretation. The questions and prompts in Figure [1](#S1.F1
    "Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction") illustrate that the GenOnet framework is designed
    with user experience in mind, providing a smooth interface with dynamic updates
    and detailed feedback on the operations performed. The following is a technical
    analysis of how this application operates:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The GenOnet processes queries through a chain-based sequence, where each step
    involves a call to an LLM, a tool, or a data preprocessing task. The technical
    workflow of the provided application starts with input handling, where the application
    receives input from the user through the chat interface. Depending on the query
    type (e.g., regular query, C++/Python-based ns-3 generation, or ns-3 execution),
    the application routes the input to the appropriate processing component. Subsequently,
    prompt construction occurs, where the input is used to create a detailed and context-specific
    prompt, leveraging templates and dynamic variables. The constructed prompt is
    then forwarded to the LLM during the interaction phase, where the model processes
    the input and generates a response. Upon receiving the response, the application
    performs post-processing tasks, including executing generated code, debugging,
    interpreting outputs, and formatting the response. Memory management is implemented
    through Streamlit’s session state, which maintains the history of interactions,
    ensuring that the conversation context is preserved across multiple exchanges.
    Finally, in the output handling stage, the processed response is rendered in the
    chat interface, formatted with custom styling, and presented to the user, completing
    the interaction loop. This entire process is designed to operate seamlessly in
    real-time, providing the user with immediate feedback and dynamic updates.

    the simulation generator functionality of GenOnet. This feature enables the app
    to automatically generate simulation scripts in both Python and C++ programming
    languages. Despite being in its initial development phase, the generator can produce
    ns-3 simulation scripts that offer users a thorough comprehension of the essential
    configuration procedures. Nevertheless, generating bug-free simulation scripts
    that can be compiled successfully remains challenging at this stage. Figure [2](#S2.F2
    "Figure 2 ‣ II System Overview") shows the result for the prompt "*I want to use
    XR traffic with the 5G-Lena NR helper, which uses a 3GPP UMI channel model with
    a frequency of 28 GHz and a 200 MHz bandwidth and 1 component carrier with 100
    UE’s. Also, I want to have a TCP application and a scanning beamforming method.*"
    The code structure of the generator closely adheres to the ns-3 C++ code examples.
    It includes the required header files, the ns-3 namespace, the NS_LOG_COMPONENT,
    the use of helpers, and the simulator Run/Destroy methods. Also, the code template
    demonstrates how to configure channel attributes such as frequency and bandwidth
    based on the user’s input. The quantity of gNBs and UEs, as determined by the
    user prompt, has been precisely configured. The code generates sample code to
    configure the TCP protocol using the bulkSendHelper based on the user’s prompt.
    The code generator indicates to the users that they have to do an attachment based
    on 5G-Lena Helper.
