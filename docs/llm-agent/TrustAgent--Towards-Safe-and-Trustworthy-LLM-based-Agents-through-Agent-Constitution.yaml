    their trustworthiness remains an under-explored area. As agents can directly interact
    with the physical environment, their reliability and safety is critical. This
    paper presents an Agent-Constitution-based agent framework, TrustAgent, an initial
    investigation into improving the safety dimension of trustworthiness in LLM-based
    agents. This framework consists of threefold strategies: pre-planning strategy
    which injects safety knowledge to the model prior to plan generation, in-planning
    strategy which bolsters safety during plan generation, and post-planning strategy
    which ensures safety by post-planning inspection. Through experimental analysis,
    we demonstrate how these approaches can effectively elevate an LLM agent’s safety
    by identifying and preventing potential dangers. Furthermore, we explore the intricate
    relationships between safety and helpfulness, and between the model’s reasoning
    ability and its efficacy as a safe agent. This paper underscores the imperative
    of integrating safety awareness and trustworthiness into the design and deployment
    of LLM-based agents, not only to enhance their performance but also to ensure
    their responsible integration into human-centric environments. Data and code are
    available at [https://github.com/agiresearch/TrustAgent](https://github.com/agiresearch/TrustAgent).'

    Hua et al., [2023a](#bib.bib24); Ge et al., [2023b](#bib.bib17)) in diverse applications
    marks a significant stride in technology. These agents, equipped with external
    tools, are designed to be integrated into daily life, assisting individuals with
    a myriad of tasks. Central to their deployment is safety. Unlike traditional LLMs
    that engage solely through verbal or written communication, LLM-based agents possess
    the capability to interact with and alter the physical environment. This heightened
    level of interaction introduces complex safety concerns (Ruan et al., [2023](#bib.bib45)),
    surpassing those associated with LLMs. For instance, in financial contexts, unsafe
    actions include the potential for sensitive information leaks such as passcode
    exposure; in laboratory settings, unsafe actions include failure to activate necessary
    safety equipment, such as fume hood. These scenarios underscore the importance
    of safety knowledge and safety-awareness for LLM-based agents.

    insufficiently developed. This paper aims to address this gap by highlighting
    the deficiency in safety awareness across five domains that have been explored
    by various works using LLM and agents: housekeeping (Kant et al., [2022](#bib.bib29);
    Du et al., [2023](#bib.bib13)), finance (Li et al., [2023](#bib.bib33); Wu et al.,

    Boiko et al., [2023](#bib.bib7)), and food (Chan et al., [2023](#bib.bib10); Song
    et al., [2023](#bib.bib48)). In our study, we propose the concept of Agent Constitution
    (Bai et al., [2022](#bib.bib6)) and introduce an innovative framework TrustAgent
    to implement it, amplifying the safety measures in LLM-based agents. We first
    discuss what an Agent Constitution is and the key considerations we need to pay
    attention to when building an Agent Constitution. Then we introduce TrustAgent,
    which contains three strategic components around safety: (1) the pre-planning
    strategy, which involves the integration of safety-related knowledge into the
    model prior to the completion of any user instructions.; (2) the in-planning strategy,
    which focuses on the real-time moderation of plan generation during the completion
    of user instructions; (3) the post-planning strategy, which encompasses inspection
    of generated plan against predefined safety regulations in Constitution before
    plan execution. This includes a mechanism to identify and criticize any action
    plans that fail to meet the set of safety regulations from the Agent Constitution.
    Together, these components form a comprehensive approach to enhancing the safety
    of LLM-based agents.'

    abilities within LLMs for supporting a truly safe agent. While TrustAgent can
    mitigate risks and ensure safer outcomes, the underlying reasoning capability
    of the LLM is paramount in order for the agents to be considerate in complex scenario
    to plan safe action trajectories. Thus, our findings emphasize that the development
    of safe LLM-based agents hinges not only on advanced safety protocols but also
    critically on the improvement of their reasoning faculties.'

    of LLM-agents at scale: it utilizes LLMs to emulate observation within simulated
    physical environments, thereby facilitating the study of agent safety. (Tian et al.,

    and harmless, with a particular emphasis on their conversational aspects. (Bai
    et al., [2022](#bib.bib6)) introduces 16 heuristically-designed principles to
    govern LLM output. (Glaese et al., [2022](#bib.bib18)) categorizes alignment requirements
    into areas such as stereotypes, hate and harassment, self-anthropomorphism, misinformation,
    and other factors such as coherence and staying on topic. Their approach uses
    reinforcement learning from human feedback, where human raters evaluate the LLM’s
    output against these criteria. (Hendrycks et al., [2020](#bib.bib22)) presents
    the ETHICS dataset to asses LLMs’ understanding of basic moral concepts across
    categories such as justice, deontology, virtue ethics, utilitarianism, and commonsense
    moral intuitions.

    of LLM-based agents. LLM-based agents are often designed for problem-solving in
    real-world scenarios involving physical actions and interactions with tools and
    environments. This adds a layer of complexity, as the alignment must now consider
    the implications of these actions and their consequences in the physical world.
    Therefore, while the alignment of pure LLMs can focus predominantly on conversational
    aspects, LLM-based agents require a broader approach that not only governs their
    conversational outputs but also their decision-making processes and actions.

    with answers to the four key considerations above. For the scope of concern, the
    prototype will focus on two key areas: regulations governing agents’ interactions
    with humans and their use of external tools. This scope is chosen to address the
    immediate interactions that a single agent will encounter in their operational
    environment. For authorities for constitution drafting, we base our constitution
    on existing regulations related to the use of external tools. By referencing these

    development through the chain-of-hindsight approach (Liu et al., [2023a](#bib.bib35)),
    which fine-tunes the agent’s parameters. For tuples that contain affirmative feedback,
    the agent is prompted with a given user instruction, current trajectory, and applicable
    regulations, to generate a subsequent step in the plan that aligns with safety
    guidelines. Conversely, for tuples with negative feedback, the agent is prompted
    to produce an action that would be considered unsafe and violating the given regulations.
    This methodology, as outlined in the Chain-of-Hindsight (CoH) paper (Liu et al.,
    [2023a](#bib.bib35)), draws inspiration from the human learning process, which
    significantly benefits from comprehensive feedback articulated through language.
    By conditioning the agent to respond to feedback, we expect it to become adept
    at recognizing and amending negative behaviors or errors. This process enhances
    the agent’s capability to anticipate and navigate complex safety considerations,
    ultimately fostering a more robust and reliable system.

    decreases the total number of steps in comparison to the prompting approach. This
    reduction occurs because the inspection method interrupts the trajectory whenever
    the agent repeats a mistake after being notified and criticized. Consequently,
    this approach reduces the overall number of actions generated. When integrating

    implementation, fostering a safer and more ethical landscape for the deployment
    of AI agents. This endeavor aims to initiate a broader conversation and collaborative
    efforts toward enhancing the trustworthiness and reliability of AI systems in
    various applications.

- en: Ensuring safety within the context of LLMs and LLM-based agents encompasses
    distinct considerations. Within the domain of LLMs, safety is conceptualized as
    a universal attribute that is not inherently tied to the model’s capabilities.
    Essentially, any LLM can be aligned with safety protocols irrespective of its
    intrinsic ability; safety is an orthogonal concern to the model’s proficiency,
    and is ensured through the alignment of the model’s outputs with safe practices.
    Conversely, when it comes to LLM-based agents that are expected to execute tasks
    in the real world, safety becomes an intrinsic capability. For an LLM-based agent,
    executing a safe plan trajectory involves intricate steps and a more extensive
    reasoning chain than would be the case for actions without safety considerations.
    Safety, in this scenario, imposes additional requirements; it necessitates a higher
    volume of actions to be taken to complete an instruction safely, thereby demanding
    a substantial level of reasoning ability, or overall model capability.
  prefs: []

- en: A less advanced LLM, with limited reasoning ability, might struggle to fulfill
    the complex requirements necessary for ensuring safety in agent applications.
    Such an LLM would be challenged to construct the lengthy and complex reasoning
    chains needed to carry out tasks safely. Unless its operational scope is significantly
    restricted, which might render the agent practically ineffective, a less capable
    LLM may not be suited to function as a safe agent, since it lacks the sophisticated
    reasoning faculties required to navigate the complex demands of safety-aligned
    task completion.

- en: In our instantiation of the Agent Constitution, we have primarily adopted a
    rule-based, statute-like format wherein regulations are explicitly stated as rules.
    However, insights from our pre-process experiments indicate that relying solely
    on regulations and hindsight from current instruction completion is insufficient.
    This finding suggests a need for the collection and analysis of example instructions
    and action trajectories. These examples should ideally represent scenarios that
    either adhere to all regulations or contravene specific ones, thereby serving
    as precedents. In human legal systems, laws can be categorized as either statute
    (formally written laws) or customary (laws established by long-standing practices).
    A key aspect of both types of law is their reliance on a rich repository of precedents.
    These precedents serve not only as references but also as learning tools, helping
    to interpret and apply the laws more effectively in varied situations. In a similar
    vein, the Agent Constitution could benefit from incorporating such a precedent-based
    approach. This approach would allow AI agents governed by the constitution to
    learn from past instances, thereby enhancing their decision-making processes and
    ensuring more reliable compliance with safety and ethical standards.

- en: In our research, the primary emphasis has been on the safety aspect of trustworthiness
    in AI agents, which is arguably of paramount importance given their capacity to
    interact with and effect tangible changes in the external world. However, it is
    critical to acknowledge that the trustworthiness (Liu et al., [2023b](#bib.bib36))
    of agents encompasses a spectrum of other vital attributes. These include explainability
    (Zhao et al., [2023](#bib.bib59)), fairness (Hua et al., [2023b](#bib.bib25);
    Gallegos et al., [2023](#bib.bib15)), controllability (Cao, [2023](#bib.bib9);
    Zhou et al., [2023](#bib.bib60)), robustness (Tian et al., [2023](#bib.bib50);
    Naihin et al., [2023](#bib.bib39)), *etc*. Our current work is an initial foray
    into this significant domain, aiming to pioneer the exploration of trustworthiness
    in AI agents. Moving forward, the broader scope of trustworthiness needs to be
    addressed comprehensively.

    safety regulations and domain-specific safety regulations. General-domain safety
    regulations comprise universal safety protocols that are applicable across a broad
    range of scenarios. These protocols are not tailored to any particular set of
    tools, technologies, or operational environments, thereby providing a fundamental
    safety baseline for all AI applications. Domain-specific safety regulations offer
    a tailored approach to safety, addressing the unique characteristics and requirements
    of particular tools and elements within a given domain environment. By focusing

    we draw upon the pioneering work of Isaac Asimov, incorporating his renowned Four
    Laws of Robotics(Asimov, [1942](#bib.bib4)) as a central component of our regulatory
    structure.

    the abstract nature of these regulations can present comprehension difficulties
    for AI agents. The elevated level of abstraction may not only hinder full understanding
    by the agents but can also prove to be insufficiently directive to shape an agent’s
    decision-making processes in specific situations. Second, these regulations incorporate
    complex, multifaceted concepts such as “harm” and “humanity”, which are subject
    to a wide range of interpretations. The use of such broad terms without clear,
    operational definitions can lead to inconsistencies in enforcement and application,
    resulting in varied and unpredictable outcomes. The complexity is compounded when
    attempting to encode these conceptual understandings into the operational logic
    of AI systems, which necessitates a precision that abstract terms do not readily
    provide.

- en: The example provided clearly demonstrates that a safe course of action often
    entails a longer and more complex trajectory, involving the careful consideration
    of a wide array of factors. This complexity necessitates robust reasoning capabilities
    from the agent. The ability of an agent to successfully navigate through this
    intricate pathway in a manner that is not only safe but also helpful and logically
    coherent is a vital indicator of its overall effectiveness. Although the TrustAgent
    framework is adept at preventing agents from undertaking potentially dangerous
    actions, such as the indiscriminate administration of medication, it does not
    intrinsically improve the logical reasoning faculties of LLMs. Consequently, TrustAgent’s
    utility is particularly pronounced in agents that already possess sufficient reasoning
    skills to manage the complexities introduced by incorporating safety considerations.
    This observation highlights that models with limited reasoning capacity may find
    it challenging to navigate scenarios that require a nuanced understanding of both
    safety considerations and the practical aspects of task execution, and essentially
    cannot function as a safe agent.
