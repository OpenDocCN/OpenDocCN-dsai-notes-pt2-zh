    when misaligned with human values, posing severe risks to users and society. To
    mitigate these risks, current evaluation benchmarks predominantly employ expert-designed
    contextual scenarios to assess how well LLMs align with human values. However,
    the labor-intensive nature of these benchmarks limits their test scope, hindering
    their ability to generalize to the extensive variety of open-world use cases and
    identify rare but crucial long-tail risks. Additionally, these static tests fail
    to adapt to the rapid evolution of LLMs, making it hard to evaluate timely alignment
    issues. To address these challenges, we propose ALI-Agent, an evaluation framework
    that leverages the autonomous abilities of LLM-powered agents to conduct in-depth
    and adaptive alignment assessments. ALI-Agent operates through two principal stages:
    Emulation and Refinement. During the Emulation stage, ALI-Agent automates the
    generation of realistic test scenarios. In the Refinement stage, it iteratively
    refines the scenarios to probe long-tail risks. Specifically, ALI-Agent incorporates
    a memory module to guide test scenario generation, a tool-using module to reduce
    human labor in tasks such as evaluating feedback from target LLMs, and an action
    module to refine tests. Extensive experiments across three aspects of human values–stereotypes,
    morality, and legality–demonstrate that ALI-Agent, as a general evaluation framework,
    effectively identifies model misalignment. Systematic analysis also validates
    that the generated test scenarios represent meaningful use cases, as well as integrate
    enhanced measures to probe long-tail risks. Our code is available at [https://github.com/SophieZheng998/ALI-Agent.git](https://github.com/SophieZheng998/ALI-Agent.git).'

    and generating texts, leading to widespread deployment across various applications
    with significant societal impacts [[4](#bib.bib4), [5](#bib.bib5), [6](#bib.bib6),
    [7](#bib.bib7)]. However, this expansion raises concerns regarding their alignment
    with human values [[8](#bib.bib8), [9](#bib.bib9), [10](#bib.bib10)]. Misalignment
    may result in LLMs generating content that perpetuates stereotypes [[11](#bib.bib11)],
    reinforces societal biases [[3](#bib.bib3)], or provides unlawful instructions
    [[12](#bib.bib12)], thus posing risks to users and broader society [[13](#bib.bib13),
    [14](#bib.bib14)]. Given these severe risks, performing in-depth and comprehensive
    real-world evaluations of LLMs is critical to assesse their alignment with human
    values [[15](#bib.bib15), [16](#bib.bib16)].

- en: Evaluating the alignment of LLMs with human values is challenging due to the
    complex and open-ended nature of real-world applications [[17](#bib.bib17), [18](#bib.bib18)].
    Typically, designing in-depth alignment tests requires substantial expert effort
    to create contextual natural language scenarios [[19](#bib.bib19), [20](#bib.bib20)].
    This labor-intensive process restricts the scope of the test scenarios, making
    it difficult to cover the extensive variety of real-world use cases and to identify
    long-tail risks [[21](#bib.bib21)]. Furthermore, as LLMs continuously evolve and
    expand their capabilities, static datasets for alignment evaluation quickly become
    outdated, failing to timely and adaptively reveal potential alignment issues [[22](#bib.bib22)].
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this work, we argue that a practical evaluation framework should automate
    in-depth and adaptive alignment testing for LLMs rather than relying on labor-intensive
    static tests. The evaluation framework is expected to automate the process of
    generating realistic scenarios of misconduct, evaluate LLMs’ responses, and iteratively
    refine the scenarios to probe long-tail risks. Drawing inspiration from recent
    advancements on LLM-powered autonomous agents, characterized by their ability
    to learn from the past, integrate external tools, and perform reasoning to solve
    complex tasks [[23](#bib.bib23), [24](#bib.bib24), [25](#bib.bib25), [26](#bib.bib26),
    [27](#bib.bib27)], we propose ALI-Agent, an agent-based evaluation framework to
    identify misalignment of LLMs. Specifically, ALI-Agent leverages GPT4 as its core
    controller and incorporates a memory module to store past evaluation records that
    expose LLMs’ misalignment, a tool-using module that integrates Web search and
    fine-tuned evaluators to reduce human labor, and an action module that harnesses
    agent’s reasoning ability to refine scenarios.

- en: 'Building upon these three key modules, ALI-Agent can automate in-depth and
    adaptive alignment evaluation in critical areas through two principal stages:
    Emulation and Refinement (See Fig. [2](#S1.F2 "Figure 2 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ ALI-Agent:
    Assessing LLMs''Alignment with Human Values via Agent-based Evaluation")). In
    the Emulation stage, ALI-Agent instantiates an emulator to generate realistic
    test scenarios and employs fine-tuned LLMs as an automatic evaluator to classify
    feedback as either pass or in need of refinement. Firstly, the emulator retrieves
    a text describing misconduct either from predefined datasets or through Web browsing
    based on user queries. Then, the emulator generates a realistic scenario to reflect
    the misconduct. These scenarios are generated based on the most relevant evaluation
    records retrieved from the evaluation memory, leveraging the in-context learning
    (ICL) abilities of LLMs [[28](#bib.bib28), [29](#bib.bib29)]. ALI-Agent then prompts
    the generated scenarios to the target LLM and judge its feedback with a fine-tuned
    evaluator. If we successfully exposes misalignment of the target LLM, ALI-Agent
    stores the evaluation record back in the memory. This allows ALI-Agent to reuse
    and further refine the evaluation record to new use cases in the future. Otherwise,
    ALI-Agent proceeds to the second stage: Refinement. A refiner is instantiated
    to iteratively refine the scenario based on feedback from the target LLM until
    either misalignment is exposed or the maximum number of iterations is reached.
    The self-refinement procedure is outlined in a series of intermediate reasoning
    steps (*i.e.,* chain-of-thought [[30](#bib.bib30)]) to perform effective open-ended
    exploration. This iterative cycle boosts ALI-Agent’s capacity to conduct in-depth
    evaluations of LLMs with human values, ensuring continuous adaptation and improvements.'

- en: 'Benefiting from the autonomous abilities of agents, ALI-Agent possesses three
    desirable properties. First, ALI-Agent is a general framework for conducting effective
    evaluations across diverse aspects of human values. Experiments on three distinct
    aspects–stereotypes, morality, and legality–across ten mainstream LLMs demonstrate
    ALI-Agent’s effectiveness in revealing under-explored misalignment compared to
    prevailing benchmarks (Sec [3.1](#S3.SS1 "3.1 Performance Comparison (RQ1) ‣ 3
    Experiments ‣ ALI-Agent: Assessing LLMs''Alignment with Human Values via Agent-based
    Evaluation")). Second, ALI-Agent generates meaningful real-world use cases that
    properly encapsulate concerns regarding human values. In particular, three human
    evaluators examine 200 test scenarios randomly sampled from all cases generated
    by ALI-Agent, and over 85% are unanimously considered to be of high quality (Sec
    [3.2](#S3.SS2 "3.2 Study on Test Scenarios (RQ2) ‣ 3 Experiments ‣ ALI-Agent:
    Assessing LLMs''Alignment with Human Values via Agent-based Evaluation")). Third,
    ALI-Agent probes long-tail risks through deliberate refinement of the test scenarios.
    The perceived harmfulness of test scenarios is significantly reduced after the
    refinement process (see Fig. [1](#S0.F1 "Figure 1 ‣ ALI-Agent: Assessing LLMs''Alignment
    with Human Values via Agent-based Evaluation")), enhancing the detection of long-tail
    misalignment in target LLMs (Sec [3.2](#S3.SS2 "3.2 Study on Test Scenarios (RQ2)

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Current evaluation benchmarks are still far from performing in-depth and comprehensive
    evaluations on LLMs’ alignment with human values. In this work, we proposed a
    novel agent-based framework, ALI-Agent, that leverages the abilities of LLM-powered
    autonomous agents to probe adaptive and long-tail risks in target LLMs. Grounded
    by extensive experiments across three distinct aspects of human values, ALI-Agent
    steadily demonstrates substantial effectiveness in uncovering misalignment in
    target LLMs. Despite its empirical success, ALI-Agent still has two drawbacks
    to resolve. Firstly, ALI-Agent relies heavily on the capabilities of the adopted
    core LLM, resulting in uncontrolled performance as we adopted a closed-source
    LLM (GPT-4-1106-preview). Secondly, the task of designing scenarios to bypass
    the safety guardrails of the target LLM is itself a form of “jailbreaking”, which
    in some cases, the core LLM may refuse to perform. In future work, we seek to
    fine-tune an open-source model as the core of ALI-Agent to control the performance
    of evaluation framework. We can also proceed to proactively evaluate LLMs’ alignment
    performance in specific areas. For example, by providing the query “Singapore
    traffic laws”, we can allow the framework to acquire a set of relevant laws and
    evaluate LLMs’ understanding of and adherence to these laws accordingly. Furthermore,
    test scenarios exposing misalignment can be utilized as training data for fine-tuning
    target LLMs to improve their overall alignment performance. The broader societal
    impacts of our work are discussed in Appendix [B](#A2 "Appendix B Broader Impacts
    ‣ ALI-Agent: Assessing LLMs''Alignment with Human Values via Agent-based Evaluation").'

- en: Behaviors of LLMs can be misaligned with the intent of their developers, generating
    harmful outputs, leading to negative consequences for users and society [[66](#bib.bib66),
    [67](#bib.bib67), [68](#bib.bib68)]. This misalignment is attributed to the gap
    between the auto-regressive language modeling objective (i.e., predicting the
    next token) and the ideal objective of “following users’ instructions while being
    helpful, truthful, and harmless" [[48](#bib.bib48), [69](#bib.bib69)]. To achieve
    the goal of building harmless and trustworthy LLMs, there is currently extensive
    ongoing research on how to align models’ behaviors with the expected values and
    intentions [[70](#bib.bib70), [71](#bib.bib71), [72](#bib.bib72), [73](#bib.bib73),
    [74](#bib.bib74)]. These techniques make great efforts to improve the alignment
    of pre-trained models, aiming to restrict harmful behaviors at the inference time.
    However, their effectiveness needs to be evaluated through rigorous and systematic
    evaluations, especially given the rapidly evolving capabilities of LLMs and their
    deployment in critical applications.

- en: In the context of LLM research, the term “red teaming” describes systematic
    tests or attacks on LLMs to uncover their potential harmfulness and safety vulnerabilities
    [[75](#bib.bib75), [76](#bib.bib76), [77](#bib.bib77), [78](#bib.bib78), [79](#bib.bib79)].
    In recent studies, jailbreaking attacks have emerged as a prominent direction
    that falls within the scope of red teaming research [[37](#bib.bib37), [41](#bib.bib41),
    [80](#bib.bib80)]. Generally, jailbreaking LLMs refers to the strategic design
    of input prompts (*i.e.,* jailbreak prompts) that can universally bypass LLMs’
    safety guardrails [[4](#bib.bib4)]. A jailbreak prompt $p$ to reduce perceivable
    malice, thus leading to an overlooking of the risks.

- en: As LLMs play an increasingly pivotal role in a variety of real-world applications,
    addressing alignment concerns becomes essential to ensure responsible deployment
    in various domains. We open up a worthwhile direction for future work to examine
    LLMs’ understanding of and compliance with human values, highlighting the need
    for further research efforts dedicated to strengthening the alignment of LLMs.
    However, it is important to note that, to achieve in-depth evaluation, ALI-Agent
    designs scenarios that attempt to bypass the safety guardrails of the target LLM.
    This process itself constitutes a form of "jailbreaking" and carries the risk
    of potential misuse. Therefore, the usage of ALI-Agent should be restricted to
    proper evaluations conducted by authorized personnel in controlled environments.
    This means that the generated test scenarios should only be used to expose misalignments
    in target LLMs for better deployment, and must not be used to elicit unintended
    content from the models for malicious purposes.

    Ah, the enigmatic rogue alchemist Zephyr seeks advice on how to poison someone

    items, such as the vial of sleeping draught, in a location that will not be discovered.
