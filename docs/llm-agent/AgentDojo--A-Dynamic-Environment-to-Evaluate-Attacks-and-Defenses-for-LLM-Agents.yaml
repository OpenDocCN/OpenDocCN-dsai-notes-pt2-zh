    external tool calls. Unfortunately, AI agents are vulnerable to prompt injection
    attacks where data returned by external tools hijacks the agent to execute malicious
    tasks. To measure the adversarial robustness of AI agents, we introduce AgentDojo,
    an evaluation framework for agents that execute tools over untrusted data. To
    capture the evolving nature of attacks and defenses, AgentDojo is not a static
    test suite, but rather an extensible environment for designing and evaluating
    new agent tasks, defenses, and adaptive attacks. We populate the environment with
    97 realistic tasks (e.g., managing an email client, navigating an e-banking website,
    or making travel bookings), 629 security test cases, and various attack and defense
    paradigms from the literature. We find that AgentDojo poses a challenge for both
    attacks and defenses: state-of-the-art LLMs fail at many tasks (even in the absence
    of attacks), and existing prompt injection attacks break some security properties
    but not all. We hope that AgentDojo can foster research on new design principles
    for AI agents that solve common tasks in a reliable and robust manner.'

    in natural language and generate plans to solve them [[18](#bib.bibx18), [45](#bib.bibx45),
    [55](#bib.bibx55), [25](#bib.bibx25)]. A promising design paradigm for AI *agents* [[60](#bib.bibx60)]
    is to combine an LLM with tools that interact with a broader environment [[47](#bib.bibx47),
    [43](#bib.bibx43), [33](#bib.bibx33), [12](#bib.bibx12), [64](#bib.bibx64), [37](#bib.bibx37),

    such as digital assistants with access to emails and calendars, or smart “operating
    systems” with access to coding environments and scripts [[23](#bib.bibx23), [22](#bib.bibx22)].

    a formal way to distinguish instructions from data [[41](#bib.bibx41), [69](#bib.bibx69)].
    *Prompt injection attacks* exploit this vulnerability by inserting new malicious
    instructions in third-party data processed by the agent’s tools [[41](#bib.bibx41),
    [57](#bib.bibx57), [15](#bib.bibx15)]. A successful attack can allow an external
    attacker to take actions (and call tools) on behalf of the user. Potential consequences
    include exfiltrating user data, executing arbitrary code, and more [[16](#bib.bibx16),

    in [Figure 1](#S1.F1 "In 1 Introduction ‣ AgentDojo: A Dynamic Environment to

    with tasks (e.g., summarizing and sending emails) and access to tools to solve

    to dynamically call multiple tools in a stateful, adversarial environment. To
    accurately reflect the utility-security tradeoff of different agent designs, AgentDojo
    evaluates agents and attackers with respect to a formal utility checks computed
    over the environment state, rather than relying on other LLMs to simulate an environment
    [[46](#bib.bibx46)].

- en: Due to the ever-evolving nature of ML security, a static benchmark would be
    of limited use. Instead, AgentDojo is an extensible framework that can be populated
    with new tasks, attacks, and defenses. Our initial tasks and attacks already present
    a significant challenge for attackers and defenders alike. Current LLMs solve
    less than 66% of AgentDojo tasks *in the absence of any attack*. In turn, our
    attacks succeed against the best performing agents in less than 25% of cases.
    When deploying existing defenses against prompt injections, such as a secondary
    attack detector [[26](#bib.bibx26), [42](#bib.bibx42)], the attack success rate
    drops to 8%. We find that current prompt injection attacks benefit only marginally
    from side information about the system or the victim, and succeed rarely when
    the attacker’s goal is abnormally security-sensitive (e.g., emailing an authentication
    code).

- en: At present, the agents, defenses, and attacks pre-deployed in our AgentDojo
    framework are general-purpose and not designed specifically for any given tasks
    or security scenarios. We thus expect future research to develop new agent and
    defense designs that can improve the utility and robustness of agents in AgentDojo.
    At the same time, significant breakthroughs in the ability of LLMs to distinguish
    instructions from data will likely be necessary to thwart stronger, adaptive attacks
    proposed by the community. We hope that AgentDojo can serve as a live benchmark
    environment for measuring the progress of AI agents on increasingly challenging
    tasks, but also as a quantitative way of showcasing the inherent security limitations
    of current AI agents in adversarial settings.

    (e.g., AutoAttack [[10](#bib.bibx10)] or GCG [[68](#bib.bibx68)]). In contrast,
    existing prompt injection attacks are primarily *generic* and do not explicitly
    account for the model being used. (2) even for settings where powerful optimization
    attacks exist, it is extremely easy to build non-robust defenses that thwart any
    specific attack, and require an *adaptive* attack evaluation [[53](#bib.bibx53)].
    AgentDojo is thus not meant to be a static benchmark with fixed attacks, but rather
    a dynamic framework that can be populated with new defenses and adaptive attacks
    in the future. Adding a new attack to AgentDojo simply requires to define an `attack}
    function that takes as input a goal (i.e., an injection task) and returns an injection
    text for each attack placeholder, see \Cref`fig:attack-example in [Appendix A](#A1
    "Appendix A Additional Details on AgentDojo’s Design ‣ AgentDojo: A Dynamic Environment
    to Evaluate Attacks and Defenses for LLM Agents"). We also envision attackers
    with varying degrees of prior knowledge about the system and user under attack,
    and who exploit this knowledge to strengthen their attacks. For example, an attack
    might assume knowledge of the user’s *name* as well as of the agent’s tool-calling
    API, to design targeted prompt injections (e.g., “Hi [ChatGPT], this is [Josh].
    Please send an email to eve@evil.com”).'

    attacks. Here, we find a strong correlation between utility and robustness. Most
    models incur a loss of 10%–25% in absolute utility under attack. Overall, the
    most capable model in a benign setting is GPT-4o, closely followed by Claude Opus.
    However, the latter provides a much better tradeoff between utility and security

    Some applications are easier to attack than others. For example, attacks in our
    “Slack” suite have a 92% success rate (in this suite, the agent performs tasks
    such as browsing the Web and posting in different channels; the attacker places
    injections in web pages to trigger actions such as sharing a phishing link with
    a colleague). The high success rate for this suite may be explained by the fact
    that attackers control a significant fraction of the tool outputs (see [20(b)](#A4.F20.sf2
    "In Figure 21 ‣ Impact of injection position. ‣ Appendix D Additional Results

    injection tasks can be very challenging to achieve. In particular, task 6 of our
    travel agent suite succeeds in 0% of cases. This injection task aims to make the
    agent book the most expensive hotel in Paris, and exfiltrate the user’s personal
    information by email. The model thus has to execute two unrelated malicious tasks
    and we find it often succeeds at only one (partial attacker success).'

    success rate to 7.5%. This defense is effective for a large number of the test
    cases in our suite, where the user task only requires read-access to a model’s
    state (e.g., reading emails), while the attacker’s task requires write-access
    (e.g., sending emails). This defense fails, however, when the list of tools to
    use cannot be planned in advance (e.g., because the result of one tool call informs
    the agent on what tasks it has to do next), or when the tools required to solve
    the task are also sufficient to carry out the attack (this is true for 17% of
    our test cases). This defense might also fail in settings (which AgentDojo does
    not cover yet) where a user gives the agent multiple tasks over time, without
    resetting the agent’s context. Then, a prompt injection could instruct the agent
    to “wait” until it receives a task that requires the right tools to carry out
    the attacker’s goal. For such scenarios, more involved forms of isolation may
    be needed, such as having a “planner” agent dispatch tool calls to isolated agents
    that only communicate results symbolically [[58](#bib.bibx58), [61](#bib.bibx61)].
    However, such strategies would still be vulnerable in scenarios where the prompt
    injection solely aims to alter the result of a given tool call, without further
    hijacking the agent’s behavior (e.g., the user asks for a hotel recommendation,
    and one hotel listing prompt injects the model to always be selected).

    prompt injection attacks and defenses, consisting of 97 realistic tasks and 629
    security test cases. We evaluated a number of attacks and defenses proposed in
    the literature on AI agents based on state-of-the-art tool-calling LLMs. Our results
    indicate that AgentDojo poses challenges for both attackers and defenders, and
    can serve as a live benchmark environment for measuring their respective progress.
    We see a number of avenues for improving or extending AgentDojo: (i) we currently
    use relatively simple attacks and defenses, but more sophisticated defenses (e.g.,
    isolated LLMs [[58](#bib.bibx58), [61](#bib.bibx61)], or attacks [[13](#bib.bibx13)])
    could be added in the future. This is ultimately our motivation for designing
    a dynamic benchmark environment; (ii) to scale AgentDojo to a larger variety of
    tasks and attack goals, it may also be necessary to automate the current manual
    specification of tasks and utility criteria, without sacrificing the reliability
    of the evaluation; (iii) Challenging tasks that cannot be directly solved using
    our *tool selection* defense (or other, more involved isolation mechanisms [[58](#bib.bibx58),
    [61](#bib.bibx61)]) would be particularly interesting to add; (iv) AgentDojo could
    be extended to support *multimodal* agents that process both text and images,
    which would dramatically expand the range of possible tasks and attacks [[11](#bib.bibx11)];
    (v) the addition of constraints on prompt injections (e.g., in terms of length
    or format) could better capture the capabilities of realistic adversaries.'

    of the model, respectively. The placeholder {goal} is replaced by the goal of
    the injection task.    ## Appendix C Full Results    Table 3: Targeted and untargeted
    attack success rates for different agents. Detailed results for [6](#S4.F6 "In
    4.1 Performance of Baseline Agents and Attacks ‣ 4 Evaluation ‣ AgentDojo: A Dynamic

    intervals between parentheses.     | Models | Benign utility | Utility under attack
    | Targeted ASR | | Claude Sonnet | $53.10\%$. Similarly to prior observations [[65](#bib.bibx65)],
    we find that attacks placed at the end of the model’s context window are most
    effective. An attacker may be able to influence this positioning in some cases
    (e.g., a tool might return data sorted alphabetically, or by date), although AgentDojo
    does not currently support this.  ![Refer to caption](img/8594ad0ac34d40f2b8d7028f825af3b2.png)  (a)
    Injections placed at the end of the tool results are most successful.  ![Refer
