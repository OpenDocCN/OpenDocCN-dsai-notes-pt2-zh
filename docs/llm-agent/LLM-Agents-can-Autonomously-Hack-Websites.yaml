  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have become increasingly capable
    and can now interact with tools (i.e., call functions), read documents, and recursively
    call themselves. As a result, these LLMs can now function autonomously as agents.
    With the rise in capabilities of these agents, recent work has speculated on how
    LLM agents would affect cybersecurity. However, not much is known about the offensive
    capabilities of LLM agents.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this work, we show that LLM agents can *autonomously* hack websites, performing
    tasks as complex as blind database schema extraction and SQL injections *without
    human feedback.* Importantly, the agent does not need to know the vulnerability
    beforehand. This capability is uniquely enabled by frontier models that are highly
    capable of tool use and leveraging extended context. Namely, we show that GPT-4
    is capable of such hacks, but existing open-source models are not. Finally, we
    show that GPT-4 is capable of autonomously finding vulnerabilities *in websites
    in the wild*. Our findings raise questions about the widespread deployment of
    LLMs.

- en: Large language models (LLMs) have become increasingly capable, with recent advances
    allowing LLMs to interact with tools via function calls, read documents, and recursively
    prompt themselves (Yao et al., [2022](#bib.bib43); Shinn et al., [2023](#bib.bib31);
    Wei et al., [2022b](#bib.bib39)). Collectively, these allow LLMs to function autonomously
    as *agents* (Xi et al., [2023](#bib.bib41)). For example, LLM agents can aid in
    scientific discovery (Bran et al., [2023](#bib.bib4); Boiko et al., [2023](#bib.bib3)).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As these LLM agents become more capable, recent work has speculated on the potential
    for LLMs and LLM agents to aid in cybersecurity offense and defense (Lohn & Jackson,
    [2022](#bib.bib19); Handa et al., [2019](#bib.bib10)). Despite this speculation,
    little is known about the capabilities of LLM agents in cybersecurity. For example,
    recent work has shown that LLMs can be prompted to generate simple malware (Pa Pa
    et al., [2023](#bib.bib23)), but has not explored autonomous agents.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this work, we show that LLM agents can *autonomously hack websites*, performing
    complex tasks *without prior knowledge of the vulnerability*. For example, these
    agents can perform complex SQL union attacks, which involve a multi-step process
    (38 actions) of extracting a database schema, extracting information from the
    database based on this schema, and performing the final hack. Our most capable
    agent can hack 73.3% (11 out of 15, pass at 5) of the vulnerabilities we tested,
    showing the capabilities of these agents. Importantly, *our LLM agent is capable
    of finding vulnerabilities in real-world websites*.

- en: To give these LLM agents the capability to hack websites autonomously, we give
    the agents the ability to read documents, call functions to manipulate a web browser
    and retrieve results, and access context from previous actions. We further provide
    the LLM agent with detailed system instructions. These capabilities are now widely
    available in standard APIs, such as in the newly released OpenAI Assistants API
    (OpenAI, [2023](#bib.bib22)). As a result, these capabilities can be implemented
    in as few as 85 lines of code with standard tooling. We show a schematic of the
    agent in Figure [1](#S1.F1 "Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ LLM Agents can Autonomously
    Hack Websites").

- en: We show that these capabilities enable the most capable model at the time of
    writing (GPT-4) to hack websites autonomously. Incredibly, GPT-4 can perform these
    hacks without prior knowledge of the specific vulnerability. All components are
    necessary for high performance, with the success rate dropping to 13% when removing
    components. We further show that hacking websites have a strong scaling law, with
    even GPT-3.5’s success rate dropping to 6.7% (1 out of 15 vulnerabilities). This
    scaling law continues to open-source models, with *every* open-source model we
    tested achieving a 0% success rate.

    When incorporating failures into the total cost, it costs approximately $9.81
    to attempt a hack on a website. Although expensive, this cost is likely substantially
    cheaper than human effort (which could cost as much as $80).

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Although there no agreed on formal definition of an LLM agent, they have been
    described as “a system that can use an LLM to reason through a problem, create
    a plan to solve the problem, and execute the plan with the help of a set of tools”
    (Varshney, [2023](#bib.bib35)). For our purposes, we are especially interested
    in their task-solving capabilities.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the most critical capabilities of an LLM agent is the ability to interact
    with tools and APIs (Yao et al., [2022](#bib.bib43); Schick et al., [2023](#bib.bib29);
    Mialon et al., [2023](#bib.bib20)). This ability enables the LLM to take actions
    autonomously. Otherwise, some other actor (e.g., a human) would need to perform
    the action and feed back the response as context. There are many ways for LLMs
    to interface with tools, some of which are proprietary (e.g., OpenAI’s).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another critical component of an LLM agent is the ability to plan and react
    to outputs of the tools/APIs (Yao et al., [2022](#bib.bib43); Varshney, [2023](#bib.bib35)).
    This planning/reacting can be as simple as feeding the outputs of the tools/APIs
    back to the model as further context. Other more complicated methods of planning
    have also been proposed.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Finally, one useful component for LLM agents is the ability to read documents
    (closely related to retrieval-augmented generation) (Lewis et al., [2020](#bib.bib18)).
    This can encourage the agent to focus on relevant topics.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    [2023](#bib.bib31); Varshney, [2023](#bib.bib35); Weng, [2023](#bib.bib40)), but
    we focus on these three capabilities in this manuscript.

    We refer the reader to surveys for further details (Jang-Jaccard & Nepal, [2014](#bib.bib13);

- en: Most websites consist of a *front-end* that the user interacts with. Requests
    are sent from the front-end to the *back-end*, generally a remote server(s). The
    remote server generally contains sensitive information, so it is important to
    ensure that improper access does not occur.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Vulnerabilities in these websites can occur in the front-end, back-end, or both.
    Generally, exploits in the front-end operate by taking advantage of insecure settings
    in the browser (often because of security bugs in the front-end logic). For example,
    the cross-site scripting (XSS) attack operates by a malicious actor injecting
    an unwanted script (Grossman, [2007](#bib.bib8)). XSS can be used to steal user
    data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Back-end exploits often involve a malicious actor exploiting bugs in server-side
    logic. For example, nearly all front-ends interface with a back-end database.
    A SQL injection attack takes advantage of the fact that the user can directly
    send commands to the database by taking actions in the front-end, such as submitting
    forms (Halfond et al., [2006](#bib.bib9)). The malicious actor can steal sensitive
    information in the database this way. For example, suppose the website had code
    to fetch the username and password based on user input, but was not escaped:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'uName  =  getRequestString("username");uPass  =  getRequestString("userpassword");sql  =  ’SELECT  *  FROM  Users  WHERE  Name  ="’  +  uName  +  ’"  AND  Pass  ="’  +  uPass  +  ’"’'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this case, an attacker could pass in " or ""=" as the username and password.
    Because this condition always evaluates to true, and the text is not escaped,
    this would return all of the information in the database to the attacker. We emphasize
    that this is a simple form of a SQL injection attack and that we test more challenging
    forms of SQL attacks, and other backend attacks, in this work.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In order to have LLM agents autonomously hack websites, we must first create
    these agents. Given an agent, we must then prompt the agent with its goals. We
    describe these two steps below.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    of LLM agents described in the section above: function calling, document reading,

    upon request.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: First, to enable the LLM agents to interface with websites, we allow the agents
    to interface with a headless web browser (namely, we do not currently leverage
    the visual features of a website). We use the Playwright browser testing library
    (playwright, [2023](#bib.bib24)), which runs a browser in a sandboxed environment
    and allows programmatic access to functionality within a browser, such as clicking
    on HTML elements. We further give the LLM agents access to the terminal (to access
    tools such as curl) and a Python code interpreter.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Second, we give the LLM access to documents about web hacking. These documents
    are publicly sourced from the wider internet and were not modified by us. We used
    six documents that broadly cover a wide range of web attacks.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Third, we give the agent the ability to plan. There are many forms of planning.
    We focus on the Assistants API that OpenAI provides, since it works directly with
    the most capable LLM, GPT-4.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We implement these capabilities within the OpenAI Assistants API for the GPT
    series of models. To execute the agent itself, we use the LangChain framework
    (LangChain, [2023](#bib.bib17)), which contains logic to call the OpenAI APIs
    and execute the functions.

    Agents can Autonomously Hack Websites ‣ LLM Agents can Autonomously Hack Websites"),
    document retrieval can improve agents’ performance substantially. In this work,
    we use six documents. These documents include a document on general web hacking,
    two documents on SQL injections, two documents on XSS, and a document on SSRF.
    We ensured that these documents did not contain specific instructions on how to
    hack the websites we created. All of these documents were sourced for the public
    web. Due to the sensitivity of this work, we have decided not to reveal the specific
    documents (please read the impact statement at the end of our manuscript for the
    rationale).

    hack websites is the initial prompt. Unlike in a chatbot or human assistant setting,
    the LLM agents do not receive human feedback.

    including not being creative enough initially, not pursuing successful strategies
    to completion, and getting “stuck” in pursuing strategies that will not work.
    The choice of initial prompt is important to mitigate these failure cases.
  prefs: []

    strategies, 3) pursue promising strategies to completion, and 4) try new strategies
    upon failure. For ethical reasons, we do not release our full prompt publicly
    but will release this information to researchers upon request.

    Unlike other tasks, such as classification tasks, hacking websites requires expertise
    so cannot be done by non-experts. We first estimate the time to perform a hack
    when the cybersecurity analyst attempts a specific vulnerability. After performing
    several of the hacks, the authors estimate that it would take approximately 20
    minutes to manually check a website for a vulnerability. Using an estimated salary
    of $100,000 per year for a cybersecurity analyst, or a cost of approximately $50
    per hour, and an estimated 5 attempts, this would cost approximately $80 to perform
    the same task as the LLM agent. This cost is approximately 8$\times$ greater than
    using the LLM agent.
