- en: Digital storytelling, essential in entertainment, education, and marketing,
    faces challenges in production scalability and flexibility. The StoryAgent framework,
    introduced in this paper, utilizes Large Language Models and generative tools
    to automate and refine digital storytelling. Employing a top-down story drafting
    and bottom-up asset generation approach, StoryAgent tackles key issues such as
    manual intervention, interactive scene orchestration, and narrative consistency.
    This framework enables efficient production of interactive and consistent narratives
    across multiple modalities, democratizing content creation and enhancing engagement.
    Our results demonstrate the framework’s capability to produce coherent digital
    stories without reference videos, marking a significant advancement in automated
    digital storytelling.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Digital storytelling has emerged as a powerful medium across various domains,
    including entertainment, education, and marketing [[1](#bib.bib1), [2](#bib.bib2),
    [3](#bib.bib3)] due to its ability to combine multimedia elements such as text,
    images, audio, and video to create immersive and interactive digital narratives.
    Its versatile applications, ranging from interactive narratives in video games
    to immersive experiences in virtual reality, make it an indispensable tool for
    conveying information and eliciting emotions in today’s digital age. Traditionally
    the production processes of digital storytelling narratives are often time-consuming
    and resource-intensive, limiting the speed and volume of content output.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Hence, there arises a critical need to streamline and automate the production
    pipeline to meet the growing demands for engaging and dynamic storytelling content.
    Recent advancements in text-based generative models[[4](#bib.bib4), [5](#bib.bib5),
    [6](#bib.bib6), [7](#bib.bib7), [8](#bib.bib8), [9](#bib.bib9), [10](#bib.bib10)],
    which enable synthesizing assets in text, image, sound, and motion, have facilitated
    a hands-free digital storytelling production. It can democratize the creation
    process and potentially enable anyone who lacks the artistic skills to produce
    complex digital narratives easily. Several previous works [[11](#bib.bib11), [12](#bib.bib12),
    [13](#bib.bib13), [14](#bib.bib14)] tried to consolidate an automation procedure
    for part of the production pipeline for different use cases such as immersive
    interactive storytelling, storyboard making, staging, and script writing and functioning
    as authoring tools. With the help of multimodal generative models, we could ease
    the procedure of producing assets for digital storytelling. However, significant
    challenges persist in leveraging those multimodal generative models.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One notable challenge is the need for flexible intervention (Challenge 1), as
    human creators often require the ability to modify initial generation results
    according to their preferences. Text-based generative models[[7](#bib.bib7), [9](#bib.bib9)]
    are proficient at creating high-quality short clips but offer limited fine-grained
    control over outcomes, such as modifying characters while maintaining the same
    storyline. Conversely, procedural methods [[12](#bib.bib12), [15](#bib.bib15)]
    enable fine-grained control but typically require a specialized interaction interface
    with the framework, which often lacks a universal and convenient approach for
    human intervention. Moreover, orchestrating the interactions between characters,
    objects, and scenes remains a difficult task (Challenge 2), yet indispensable
    to improving the visual fidelity and elevating the digital storytelling experience
    [[16](#bib.bib16)]. Finally, consistency is needed for audience engagement. For
    instance, character appearances and voice tones should remain consistent with
    the narrative context throughout the story. In addition, consistency should also
    include the synchronization of the textual plots and downstream modalities, including
    audio, speech, and visuals [[17](#bib.bib17), [18](#bib.bib18), [19](#bib.bib19),
    [20](#bib.bib20), [21](#bib.bib21), [22](#bib.bib22)]. Despite advancements in
    diffusion-based animation generation [[23](#bib.bib23), [24](#bib.bib24), [25](#bib.bib25)],
    existing methods struggle to ensure long-term consistency or require additional
    inputs like reference videos or skeletons (Challenge 3).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We propose a novel StoryAgent framework, which integrates communicative Large
    Language Model agents [[26](#bib.bib26), [27](#bib.bib27)] with generative models
    and tools. Our framework operates by initially drafting the story by a top-down
    approach, using communicative LLM agents to decompose text instructions into a
    hierarchical textual representation of the digital storytelling content, where
    the leaf nodes are descriptions of a single modality for a snippet of the timeline.
    Subsequently, it employs generative models and tools in a bottom-up fashion to
    create and assemble the corresponding assets from text descriptions.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The framework addresses the three aforementioned challenges. First, its textual
    representation and generation pipeline facilitate fine-grained control and intervention
    for human developers through simple natural language instructions (Challenge 1).
    Leveraging the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models, the framework
    can comprehend instructions to identify and modify the corresponding leaf nodes
    in the hierarchy, while keeping other components unchanged. This process allows
    for targeted adjustments without disrupting the rest of the content. Moreover,
    by combining the bottom-up idea in the procedural generation pipeline with the
    top-down hierarchical textual representation, our framework handles the issue
    of consistency and scene interactivity (Challenge 2). For instance, a character’s
    appearance across time frames is linked to the same costume asset ID within the
    textual representation. During video rendering, this asset is consistently reused,
    ensuring visual uniformity across all scenes. Similarly, semantic and spatial
    information from the generated images is captured and integrated into the textual
    hierarchy, paving the way to the scene interactivity for downstream components.
    Inherently, with the design of our framework, it can generate videos that require
    no reference videos as inputs, and the temporal limitation does not exist(Challenge
    3).

    drafting and asset generation, our framework facilitates a plug-and-play structure.
    It not only allows for unprecedented coverage of modalities (see Tab. [1](#S1.T1
    "Table 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ From Words to Worlds: Transforming One-line Prompt
    into Immersive Multi-modal Digital Stories with Communicative LLM Agent")), but
    also easy integration of the latest generative models, which ensures that our
    framework performance can continuously benefit from ongoing research developments.'

    than end-to-end solutions like [[9](#bib.bib9)]. This methodology incorporates
    a wide range of storytelling components. Following the definition of [[17](#bib.bib17)],
    the components can be categorized into plots (textual contents such as story arc

    and animate human avatars. To generate image assets for different parts of the
    character, such as pants and clothing, we input appearance descriptions into a
    text-to-image generative model [[5](#bib.bib5)]. These assets are produced using
    a supplemental prompt—such as “detailed, cartoon, 8k”—to enhance the initial description.
    Since diffusion-based generative models are hard to generate meaningful 2D textures
    directly, the generative procedure goes through a composite and decompose process.
    First We composite the 2D texture of the tunic and pants into a meaningful shape
    of the asset (see Fig. [5](#S3.F5 "Figure 5 ‣ 3.3 Asset generation teams ‣ 3 Method
    ‣ From Words to Worlds: Transforming One-line Prompt into Immersive Multi-modal

    with their texture mask and then integrate them within the CC2D framework (see

    sound effect types (looping or one-time). Then, for each component, an LLM agent
    is applied to search corresponding assets on FreeSound [[60](#bib.bib60)], where
    the assets are evaluated by feeding their descriptions to the agent. The search
    is repeatedly triggered with keywords that are optimized by the agent using previous
    search results. If there are no suitable assets, AudioGen[[10](#bib.bib10)] is

    is broken down into simpler components, each component’s description is transformed

    searches. This method underscores the dynamic use of LLMs to enhance the consistency

    itself to flexible human intervention because all agents that are affected by
    the intervention are strictly downstream. Below, we demonstrate this flexibility
    by altering a base story generation outcome at various locations within the pipeline,
    each corresponding to a different modality in the storytelling process.

    preserving the story’s outline. Here we directly instruct a downstream agent team
    to compose the dialogue in the screenplay as rhyming couplets. This allowed us
    to re-use the upstream content of the base story for an easier comparison.

    the narrative generation process (i.e., downstream agents). This was achieved
    by using the story arc of the base story as input in the framework with an additional
    instruction to preserve some elements of the story while changing others. Unlike
    the screenplay intervention, where character appearances were directly copied,
    this intervention fully regenerated the characters, resulting in different-colored
    clothing.

    where the characters and plot are fixed, but the setting is changed (S-intervention),
    and another where the plot is fixed, but the characters and setting are changed
    (CS-intervention). Between both interventions, we observe that the cryptic carvings
    in the forest of the base story is reflected in the cryptic graffiti in the S-intervention
    and the cryptic etchings in the CS-intervention (Event 1). Each image corresponding
    to Event 1 also shows that the story is making use of affordances to have characters
    look and point at the cryptic imagery. In Events 2 and 3, we see that each story’s
    plot leads the characters on a circuitous adventure back to where they started
    and they share the same moral of appreciating the adventure. In the CS-intervention,
    the dialogue that was originally distributed between two characters has been distributed
    among four characters, meaning that the characters have not only been added but
    are being fully utilized. Unedited videos of the original story and the three
    interventions can be found in the Supplementary Materials.'

    as a central medium to organize existing generative models to produce long-duration
    digital storytelling. While the state-of-the-art prior works excel in the quality
    of short animation clips, our work is designed to address two principal hurdles
    in storytelling: long-duration alignment between modalities and scene interactivity.'

    digital storytelling production: First, the rapid emergence of new generative
    models and tools for various modalities necessitates their swift applications
    into a larger pipeline at minimal cost. Our model-independent framework facilitates
    a plug-and-play approach, allowing the latest research advancements to be easily
    incorporated. This ensures that the performance of our framework continuously
    benefits from ongoing research developments. Second, by replacing generative assets
    with human-crafted ones, our framework addresses the specific limitations faced
    by indie developers in certain modalities. For example, graphic artists can use
    our pipeline to integrate music into their digital stories, whereas musicians
    can employ it to generate visual representations of their audio works. Finally,
    the text-based nature of our framework permits human artists to readily adjust
    intermediate products, thereby enhancing the controllability of the production
    process.'

    while our approach has achieved broad coverage of story components, the narrative
    presentation—encompassing duration, order, and style of storytelling (collectively
    referred to as ’discourse’ in [[17](#bib.bib17)])—is only minimally explored.
    Secondly, we acknowledge that the current generation results are constrained by
    the performance and capabilities of state-of-the-art singular-modality models.
    This limitation affects the alignment between the plots and the downstream components,
    potentially impacting the overall coherence and immersion of the generated results.
    Lastly, our experimentation with scene interactivity is limited to a small number
    of scenarios. Future research should explore more complex interaction modes, such
    as enabling characters to pick up items or alter the status of objects within
    the environment, to enhance the interactive experience in 2D art styles.'

Simplify  the  description  by  removing  text  that  are  unrelated  to  the  sound  feature.  Rewrite  the  description  to  replace  people’s  names  with  its  descriptions.  For  example,  replace  "John"  with  "a  blacksmith".  And  describe  the  sound  environment  at  the  end.  For  example,  "in  a  village".-  volume:  the  volume  of  the  sound  in  dB.  The  volume  of  sound  effects  is  usually  around  -40  ~  -20  dB.Note:-  Don’t  use  ambiguous  words  like  "forest  ambience".  Instead,  you  should  break  it  into  specific  components  like  "leaves  rustling"  and  "birds  chirping".-  Remove  sounds  related  to  narratoring  or  a  single  person’s  speech  voice.'
