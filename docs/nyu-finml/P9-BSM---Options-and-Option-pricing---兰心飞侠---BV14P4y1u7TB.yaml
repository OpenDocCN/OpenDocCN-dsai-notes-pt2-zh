    cases for reinforcement learning algorithms。 Such test cases are very useful as
    they not only let us see how a particular reinforcement learning algorithm works
    in this setting when we know what to expect。

    as positions and velocities。 these variables can be discretized。 Upon discretization。
    the system is mapped onto a mark of decision process problem with a discrete state
    and action space。 All methods that we outlined before plus many other methods
    of reinforcement learning for MDPs can be tried in such setting。

    reinforcement learning algorithms。 But because in this course we deal with finance，
    it would be good to have a setting for finance that would be as simple as the
    pole balancing problem。

    of modern quantitative finance。 I mentioned this model to you in our first course
    on supervised learning when we talked about Merton's model of corporate defaults。
    So let's start with a quick recap of the Merton model for defaults。

- en: The Merton model offers a simplified view of a firm that has a single asset
    called the firm value that is modeled as a geometric Brownian motion with a diff。
    If the firm value is below the level of debt at that maturity time t and equity
    holder defaults on your payment to a bond holder that finances the firm。
  id: totrans-18

- en: In this case she hands the firm asset to the bond holder and the stock becomes
    worthless。 Otherwise the stock value at time t is equal to the difference between
    the firm value t and the debt level k。 We discussed the implications of the Merton
    model to predict corporate defaults and said that a particular expression obtained
    in this model for a default probability can be viewed as a structure。 A model
    based a default model that corresponds to very specific assumptions about the
    dynamics of the system。

- en: Now the Merton model for corporate default gives the default probability and
    also computes how much both the debt of the firm and the stock of the firm are
    valued now。 But what if the stock holder offered you to pay her now in order to
    be able to buy her future stock from her at the later time key。

    contract is called an option or a financial derivative。 Both names explain the
    nature of this instrument。 First it is an option and not an obligation which means
    that you will not have to pay a price k at time t to get the stock if you see
    by that time that the stock does not perform well。 It's also called a derivative
    because its value is derived from a value of the stock。

- en: What I just described is a most simple type of a stock option called the European
    call option on the stock。 To reiterate such a financial contract works as follows。
    A buyer of such option gets a right to get the stock at a later time t for a press
    specified amount k。 also known as the option strike。 The strike k is set contractually
    at the start of the option。
  id: totrans-24

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now the value of the option at the maturity time t is given by the formula shown
    here。 It is a maximum of the difference between the final stock price S at t and
    the strike k and zero。 The meaning of this is simple。 If the final stock price
    S at t is above the strike k then it makes a perfect sense for a buyer of such
    option to get the stock。 The stock can be immediately sold for the market price。

- en: The profit to the option buyer in this case would be the difference S at t minus
    k。 But if the terminal stock price is below k then exercising such an option would
    not make sense for a buyer。 So the option payoff is zero in such case。 This option
    payoff at maturity time t is shown on the graph here。 The payoff is zero for any
    terminal value ST below k and grows linearly for values of ST above k。

    model was developed to answer exactly this question。 It was developed around the
    same time as the Merton corporate default model in 1973 by Fisher Black。 Myron，
    Scholes and Robert Merton and was awarded a Nobel Prize in Economics in 1997 to
    Scholes and Merton。 three years after Fisher Black died of cancer in 1994。
