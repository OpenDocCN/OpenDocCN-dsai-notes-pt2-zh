- en: In the last week we saw how the problem of option pricing and hedging can be
    formulated。 as a reinforcement learning model。 In this week we will talk about
    applications of reinforcement learning for stock trading。 We will discuss various
    problems in quantitative trading that amounts to reinforcement learning。 tasks。
    We will talk about such problems as optimal portfolio execution。

    portfolio model that allows us to address all these problems。 in the same modeling
    framework。 We will then introduce reinforcement learning approach to such problems
    that learns optimal。

    Then we will discuss an inverse reinforcement learning setting for these problems
    where we。 do not observe rewards and we will see why it may be more useful than
    direct reinforcement。 learning setting in many problems of practical interest。

    how it can。 be applied to learn a reward function， also called a utility function
    of an investor or。 even of a market。 And finally we will look at the same model
    but apply it this time to all investors simultaneously。 and show how we can use
    inverse reinforcement learning to learn market optimal trading strategies。

    as we already did a few times in this specialization。 this， week will simultaneously
    serve as an introduction to the last course in this specialization where。 we will
    talk about more involved applications of reinforcement learning to problems of
    finance。
