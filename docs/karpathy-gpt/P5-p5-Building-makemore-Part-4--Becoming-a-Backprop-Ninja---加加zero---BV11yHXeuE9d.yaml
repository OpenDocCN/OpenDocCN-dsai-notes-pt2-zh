    by that is。 backpropagation doesn't just make your neural networks just work magically
    it's not the case。 that you can just stack up arbitrary Lego blocks of the furnishable
    functions and just。 cross your fingers and back propagate and everything is great
    things don't just work automatically。

    log probabilities to。 get our loss。 So basically what we have is for a single

    where p here is kind of like thought of as a vector of。 all the probabilities。
    So at the y position， where y is the label。 And we have that p here。
  id: totrans-602

    is just the softmax function。 So raising all the logits basically to the power
    of e and normalizing， so everything， comes to one。 Now if you write out p of y
    here， you can just write out the softmax。 and then basically what we're interested
    in is we're interested in the derivative of the loss。

    here， where we。 have l indexed with the specific label y。 And on the bottom we
    have a sum over j of e to the lj。 and the negative log of all that。 So potentially
    give it a shot pen and paper and see if you can。 actually derive the expression
    for the loss by dli， and then we're going to implement it here。

    actually need to sum over all those eyes from i。 equal to one to m of the dl by

    propagate into mu and then eventually into， X。 So now let's continue our back

    if our mini batch。 size is 32， as it is in our example that we were working on，

    here。 And then plus the one arrow from here。 which is dl， by d sigma square times

    of it。 Simplifying here is not complicated， the first term。 And you， just get

    that， happens。 When we look at d sigma square by d mu and we simplify， at one

    have a mathematical expression like this， and you look at d sigma， square by d
    mu。
  id: totrans-656

    if。 it is the special case that mu is actually equal to the average， as it is
    in the case of。 rationalization， that gradient will actually vanish and become
    zero。 So the whole term cancels。 and we just get a fairly straightforward expression
    here for dl by d mu。 Okay。
  id: totrans-657

    is just a function of Xi and all the。 other scalars。 So Xi hat only depends on
    Xi and none of the other X's。 And so therefore。 there are actually in this single

    hat。 And so in back propagation， we now need to apply the chain。 rule。 And we

    we've achieved。 before。 And then here， I'm sampling from the model， and we see
    some of the name like gibberish。 that we're sort of used to。 So basically， the
    model worked and samples， pretty decent results。 compared to what we're used to。
    So everything is the same。 But of course， the big deal is that we。

    our gradients。 ourselves by hand。 And so hopefully you're looking at this， the
    backward pass of this neural net。 and you're thinking to yourself， actually， that's
    not too complicated。 Each one of these layers is。 like three lines of code or
    something like that。 And most of it is fairly straightforward。

    So hopefully。 you found this interesting。 And what I liked about it， honestly，
    is that it gave us a very nice。 diversity of layers to back propagate through。
    And I think it gives a pretty nice and comprehensive。 sense of how these backward
    passes are implemented and how they work。 And you'd be able to derive。

    want to use the。 pytorch autograd。 But hopefully， you have some intuition about
    how gradients flow backwards through。 the neural net， starting at the loss， and
    how they flow through all the variables and all the。 intermediate results。 And
    if you understood a good chunk of it， and if you have a sense of that。
