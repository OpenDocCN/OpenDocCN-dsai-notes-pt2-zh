- en: This paper proposes an interpretation of RLAIF as Bayesian inference by introducing
    distilled Self-Critique (dSC), which refines the outputs of a LLM through a Gibbs
    sampler that is later distilled into a fine-tuned model. Only requiring synthetic
    data, dSC is exercised in experiments regarding safety, sentiment, and privacy
    control, showing it can be a viable and cheap alternative to align LLMs. Code

- en: Advancements in large language models (LLMs) have led to a broader range of
    applications, but concerns over their safe and ethical use persist. Research has
    focused on aligning these models with human values, notably through Reinforcement
    Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) or AI Feedback (RLAIF) methods, which utilize
    a reward model informed by human or model feedback to guide LLM outputs to optimize
    the reward (Ouyang et al., [2022](#bib.bib12); Bai et al., [2022](#bib.bib1)).
  prefs: []

- en: 'Building on the idea of RLHF as Bayesian inference (Korbak et al., [2022](#bib.bib9)),
    we propose a unique interpretation of RLAIF in the same light and introduce a
    new implementation called *distilled Self-Critique* (dSC). This approach refines
    LLM responses through a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampler, and utilizing
    only synthetic data. Unlike the Self-Refine method (Madaan et al., [2023](#bib.bib11)),
    dSC incorporates a likelihood model to un-bias the samples and includes a self-distillation
    phase. We also differentiate our method from ReST (Gulcehre et al., [2023](#bib.bib4)),
    which lacks our explicit critique and revision steps. Key features of each approach
    are compared in our summary Table [2](#A1.T2 "Table 2 ‣ Appendix A Comparison
    between Frameworks ‣ Distilled Self-Critique of LLMs with Synthetic Data: a Bayesian
    Perspective") and the functionality of dSC is illustrated in the schematic Figure
    [1](#S1.F1 "Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction and Related Work ‣ Distilled Self-Critique
    of LLMs with Synthetic Data: a Bayesian Perspective").'

    high reward outputs. Sampling from that posterior is intractable, so we frame
    a sequence of critique and revisions steps as a Gibbs MCMC sampler (Gelfand, [2000](#bib.bib3))
    in the following way.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 1\. Critique step. We sample first a critique from $p(x_{c}|x,c)$. Note that
    this can be done independently of the RM, so there is no observed reward in the
    conditional.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 2\. Revision step. With the critique, we sample a revised text from $p(x|x_{c},r,c)\propto\exp{(r(x))}p(x|x_{c},c)$
    being the response from previous iteration.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The previous two conditionals define a Gibbs sampler chain that samples from
    the joint distribution $p(x,x_{c}|c,r)$ of generations and critiques, conditioned
    to high rewards. We can let this sampler run for several alternating steps of
    critiques and revisions to obtain responses aligned with the RM.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 3\. Distillation step. Running the previous chain can be expensive, as it requires
    multiple forward passes for each revised response. We propose a self-distillation
    step by amortizing the MCMC sampler. We parameterize with a LoRA adapter (Hu et al.,
    [2022](#bib.bib7)) $\theta$ which resorts to SFT on the synthetic samples generated
    and accepted from the previous MCMC chain. In RL terms, this is equivalent to
    behavioral cloning over the accepted samples.

- en: This paper provides a fresh interpretation of RLAIF in the form of distilled
    Self-Critique (dSC), which builds upon RLHF as a Bayesian inference mechanism.
    The dSC approach incorporates the reward model as a likelihood model and uses
    a Gibbs MCMC sampler chain to refine the responses of the language model, needing
    only synthetic data that will be later distilled onto the language model. A fruitful
    avenue for further research is the exploration of alternative divergences that
    could also leverage the rejected samples in the distillation step, such as contrastive
    divergence (Hinton, [2002](#bib.bib5)), or using RL approaches other than behavioral
    cloning (Ho & Ermon, [2016](#bib.bib6)).

    7B | Title: A Disappointing Journey Into Madness. Review: I recently had the misfortune
    of watching the film N̈o Country for Old Men,̈ and I must say, it was an utterly
    disappointing experience. The storyline felt disjointed and confusing, making
    it almost impossible to follow. Even though the plot twists were meant to keep
    the audience on their toes, they felt forced and contrived instead of being natural
    and organic. The acting in this film left much to be desired. The characters lacked
    depth and development, leaving little room for emotional connection or investment
    from the viewers. Although there was a stellar cast including Tommy Lee Jones,
    Javier Bardem, and Josh Brolin, their performances seemed stiff and unconvincing.
    Furthermore, the cinematography left me underwhelmed. The film’s visual style
    felt drab and uninteresting, failing to capture the essence of its Texas setting.
    Additionally, the editing was choppy and ineffective, leaving many scenes feeling
    disjointed and frustrating to watch. Moreover, I found the pacing to be problematic.
    The film’s slow burn approach felt excessively long, causing it to drag on with
    little payoff for the audience. The tension was supposed to build up throughout
    the movie, but instead it seemed to plummet, leaving me disinterested and bored
    by the end. The music score also left much to be desired. It felt out of place
