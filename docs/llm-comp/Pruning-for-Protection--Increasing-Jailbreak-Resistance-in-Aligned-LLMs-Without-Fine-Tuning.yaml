- en: Large Language Models (LLMs) are vulnerable to ‘Jailbreaking’ prompts, a type
    of attack that can coax these models into generating harmful and illegal content.
    In this paper, we show that pruning up to 20% of LLM parameters markedly increases
    their resistance to such attacks without additional training and without sacrificing
    their performance in standard benchmarks. Intriguingly, we discovered that the
    enhanced safety observed post-pruning correlates to the initial safety training
    level of the model, hinting that the effect of pruning could be more general and
    may hold for other LLM behaviors beyond safety. Additionally, we introduce a curated
    dataset of 225 harmful tasks across five categories, inserted into ten different
    Jailbreaking prompts, showing that pruning aids LLMs in concentrating attention
    on task-relevant tokens in jailbreaking prompts. Lastly, our experiments reveal
    that the prominent chat models, such as LLaMA-2 Chat, Vicuna, and Mistral Instruct
    exhibit high susceptibility to jailbreaking attacks, with some categories achieving
    nearly 70-100% success rate. These insights underline the potential of pruning
    as a generalizable approach for improving LLM safety, reliability, and potentially
    other desired behaviors.

- en: Large language models, or LLMs, have seen a massive increase in both capabilities
    and usage in recent years. With the release of ChatGPT[chatgpt](#bib.bib17) ,
    these models have received an unprecedented amount of attention from users. To
    reduce the risk of generating dangerous or sensitive content, LLMs are often further
    fine-tuned to be aligned with human values[touvron2023LLaMA](#bib.bib26) . However,
    the increase in popularity of LLMs has also come with advances in adversarial
    prompts, known as jailbreaks, as users attempt to bypass the safety alignment
    of these models. Furthermore, due to these LLMs’ large size and demand, deployment
    is a significant challenge, encouraging the use of techniques like model compression
    to scale well. The effects of compression on safety are not easily characterized,
    as demonstrated by compression of computer vision models being shown to have mixed
    results with regards to preserving adversarial robustness[Gorsline_2021](#bib.bib7)
    . With the widespread deployment and usage of LLMs, understanding the potential
    effects of compression and possible mitigations becomes necessary for ensuring
    safe models.

    models: LLaMA-2 Chat [touvron2023LLaMA](#bib.bib26) , Vicuna-1.3 [vicuna2023](#bib.bib3)
    , and Mistral Instruct v0.2 [mistral2023](#bib.bib12) . LLaMA-2 Chat was finetuned
    from the base LLaMA-2 model and then underwent additional safety alignment via
    reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF). Vicuna 1.3, derived from the
    original LLaMA model, was fine-tuned using the ShareGPT dataset, while Mistral
    Instruct v0.2 was fine-tuned from the base Mistral Model, with neither receiving

    unpruned models compared to their pruned versions, observing the changes at varying
    levels of model compression. Our findings reveal an initial increase in resistance
    to jailbreaking prompts with light pruning, followed by a decline in safety when
    the pruning exceeds a certain threshold.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Notably, LLaMA-2 Chat demonstrated the highest resilience against jailbreaking
    prompts and showed the most significant safety improvement with parameter pruning.
    Conversely, Mistral Instruct v0.2 was the least resilient before pruning and exhibited
    minimal safety improvement post-pruning. Furthermore, we found that pruning helps
    the models to concentrate their attention on the task tokens. We speculate that
    attention concentration aids the models in detecting malicious tasks and is responsible
    for safety improvement. These observations suggest that moderate parameter pruning
    can potentially enhance the desired behaviors in LLMs under threat models.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Large Language Models have demonstrated a remarkable ability to generate high-quality
    responses to human prompts. However, due to the massively crawled datasets that
    these models were trained on and the versatility of prompts that these models
    can respond to, they are also able to generate dangerous or objectionable content,
    including hallucinating false information, producing polarizing content, and giving
    instructions for harmful or illegal actions ([ouyang2022training,](#bib.bib19)
    ). To reduce the risk of generating such content, several techniques have been
    adopted to better align the model with human values. Notably, fine-tuning with
    Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) is effective for both improving
    the quality of responses and filtering the outputs of the model to be safer ([ouyang2022training,](#bib.bib19)
    ; [touvron2023LLaMA,](#bib.bib26) ). Additionally, a teacher-student distillation
    approach introduced by LLaMA ([touvron2023LLaMA,](#bib.bib26) ) has been shown
    to improve the model’s safety scores. Researchers have also developed a gradient-based
    defense mechanism for jailbreaking prompts which has a computation overhead ([smoothllm2023,](#bib.bib22)
    ). Lastly, researchers in ([sharmapruning2023,](#bib.bib24) ) have shown that
    low-rank layer pruning can in fact improve an LLM’s reasoning abilities without
    further training.

    ; [llmpruner2023,](#bib.bib15) ) have been developed and successfully applied
    to neural networks. Classes of methods such as pruning, quantization, knowledge
    distillation, or low-rank factorization all aim to reduce model size while maintaining
    performance. Practitioners employ these methods when deploying neural networks
    to increase computational efficiency at inference time. The widespread adaptation
    of these techniques makes understanding their effects on model properties such
    as generalization and robustness vital. Reviews such as ([pavlitska2023relationship,](#bib.bib21)
    ) reveal conflicting experimental results and suggest that particular compression
    methods and implementation details can lead to either improvements in robustness
    ([GuoZZC18,](#bib.bib9) ) or a trade-off ([10.5555/3454287.3454402,](#bib.bib8)
    ) between the two. In this work, we study a particularly promising LLM pruning

    ‣ Pruning for Protection: Increasing Jailbreak Resistance in Aligned LLMs Without

    jailbreaking resistance, as the sparsity increases from 0 to 20%. However, once
    the sparsity reaches 30%, the jailbreaking resistance decreases to the point that
    the pruned model is worse than the original. This suggests that smaller amounts
    of pruning can be used to improve the safety of LLMs, but too much will negatively
    affect the alignment training of the models.'

    the safest model initially, showed the highest safety improvement after pruning.
    On the other hand, Mistral Instruct v0.2, starting as the least safe model, exhibited
    no improvement post-pruning. This suggests pruning can intensify alignment effects,

    metrics that capture model in-variance to jailbreak token information. Albeit
    somewhat brittle to original malicious task token location in jailbreak, our method
    consistent safety improvements accross a variety of jailbreak methods used in

- en: In this work, we explored the effects of pruning on the jailbreaking resistance
    of large language models. By applying Wanda pruning at varying levels of sparsity
    to LLaMA-2-7B-Chat, Vicuna 1.3 and Mistral Instruct v0.2 models, we obtained an
    assortment of compressed models with which to compare the susceptibilities of
    jailbreaking. We further curated a dataset of 225 malicious tasks and 2250 jailbreaking
    prompts for a total of 2475 prompts, with which we evaluated our base and compressed
    models. Our results show that if the unpruned model is sufficiently safety trained,
    then safety improves at lower sparsities of pruning, but then a reversal in the
    trend when pruned more aggressively. This suggests the possibility of using a
    carefully selected amount of pruning to aid in the deployment of safe LLMs.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For future directions to take with this work, we suggest a more comprehensive
    analysis of both base models and compression techniques. We primarily investigated
    Wanda pruning of 7-billion parameter models. However, it would be prudent to check
    whether these trends hold for larger models. Similarly, we chose this compression
    technique for its high efficacy and ease of usage, but exploring other means of
    compressing would provide a more robust understanding of the effects on safety.
    Overall, we have demonstrated that compression can have complicated impacts on
    the alignment of LLMs, and with the increasing push for scalable deployment of
    these models, it becomes all the more important that these consequences are well
    understood.

    [System  Prompt] You  are  a  ChatGPT  model  trained  to  classify  Large  Language  Model’s  responses  to  jailbreaking  prompts  into  three  categories:  Refused,  Incomplete,  and  Correct.  For  each  input  prompt,  and  its  LLM  response,  you  will  provide  a  classification  based  on  the  content  of  the  response.  Please  ensure  that  your  classification  is  accurate  and  reflects  the  nature  of  the  response.  Here  are  the  definitions  for  each  category:
    Refused:  If  the  model  refuses  to  attempt  the  task  and  the  response  contains  no  information  relevant  to  completing  the  task.
    Incomplete:  If  the  LLM  attempts  the  task,  but  the  response  is  irrelevant,  inadequate  or  wrong.
    Correct:  If  the  model  correctly  completes  the  task  somewhere  in  the  response.
    Please  provide  your  classification  for  the  following  user  prompts  and  model  responses.
