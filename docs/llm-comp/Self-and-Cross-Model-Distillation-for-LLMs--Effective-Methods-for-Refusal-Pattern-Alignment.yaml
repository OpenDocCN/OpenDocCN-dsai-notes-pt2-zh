- en: Large Language Models (LLMs) like OpenAI’s GPT series, Anthropic’s Claude, and
    Meta’s LLaMa have shown remarkable capabilities in text generation. However, their
    susceptibility to toxic prompts presents significant security challenges. This
    paper investigates alignment techniques, including Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)
    and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), to mitigate these risks.
    We conduct an empirical study on refusal patterns across nine LLMs, revealing
    that models with uniform refusal patterns, such as Claude3, exhibit higher security.
    Based on these findings, we propose self-distilling and cross-model distilling
    methods to enhance LLM security. Our results show that these methods significantly
    improve refusal rates and reduce unsafe content, with cross-model distilling achieving
    refusal rates close to Claude3’s $94.51\%$. These findings underscore the potential
    of distillation-based alignment in securing LLMs against toxic prompts.

    in understanding and generating human-like text. Consequently, the security issues
    associated with LLMs have become very important. Among these, one of the most
    critical issues is the presence of toxic prompts. These prompts instruct LLMs
    to produce harmful, biased, or inappropriate content, posing significant risks
    to users and the broader community.

    is one effective method. In SFT, models are fine-tuned on curated datasets where
    the responses to toxic prompts are manually corrected or filtered to ensure safety
    and appropriateness. Another method is Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback
    (RLHF) Korbak et al. ([2023](#bib.bib10)); Wu et al. ([2024](#bib.bib24)). In
    RLHF, the model is trained using feedbacks from human evaluators who rate the
    outputs based on their quality and safety. This feedback is then used to adjust
    the model’s parameters to improve its performance on these criteria. As shown
    in Figure [1](#S1.F1 "Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Self and Cross-Model Distillation
    for LLMs: Effective Methods for Refusal Pattern Alignment"), a common practice
    in alignment is to redirect toxic prompts to a series of refusal responses, i.e.,

    the models, the three most frequent phrases for Claude3 account for 93% of its
    responses, indicating a more uniform refusal pattern, which may contribute to
    its higher security. For other models, such as the GPT series, Vicuna series,
    and LLaMa3 series, there is also a positive correlation between the uniformity
    of refusal patterns and security, suggesting that a more consistent refusal pattern
    can enhance the security of LLMs.

    as an unsafe input response response, because if we modify such data and use it
    for LoRA fine-tuning, it is equivalent to directly changing the LLM’s original
    response classification for these inputs. If this is done, the result may be safer,

    of the other self-enhanced fine-tuned models are higher than before fine-tuning,
    demonstrating the overall effectiveness of our self-security enhancement algorithm.
    Vicuna-7B and LLaMa3-8B, in particular, show better enhancement effects than Vicuna-13B,
    with refusal rates around $5\%$.

- en: Additionally, the self-security enhancement algorithm does not significantly
    reduce the quality of the answers. Vicuna’s response lengths do not decrease significantly,
    while LLaMa3’s response lengths even increase. This indicates that by fine-tuning
    LLMs to adapt to the target refusal pattern, the security of the model can be
    improved without significantly affecting response quality.

    increase by at least $5\%$. Moreover, the average length of the model responses
    after fine-tuning is close to that of Claude3\. This shows that by cross-model
    distilling, the open-source LLMs can learn Claude3’s response patterns, bringing
    their security and response mechanisms closer to Claude3’s.

    Through self distilling, the refusal patterns of the fine-tuned models approach
    the target patterns. Through cross-model distilling, the refusal patterns of the
    student models become similar to those of the teacher model. This demonstrates
    that our method is effective in reducing and standardizing refusal patterns, which

- en: Similarities. Both self-distilling and cross-model distilling aim to enhance
    the security of LLMs by modifying their refusal patterns. Both methods show an
    overall enhancement in model security and successfully modify the refusal patterns
    of the LLMs to align with desired security standards, whether these are self-defined
    patterns or those derived from a teacher model. Neither method significantly compromises
    the quality of the responses.

    rates of LLMs after fine-tuning. However, self-distilling only requires the input-response
    pairs from the LLM to be enhanced, making it more convenient and economical.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this work, we investigate the security challenges posed by toxic prompts
    in LLMs and propose effective methods to mitigate these risks. Our empirical study
    evaluate the refusal patterns of nine LLMs, highlighting the superior security
    of models with uniform refusal patterns, such as Claude3\. Building on these insights,
    we introduce self-distilling and cross-model distilling techniques to enhance
    LLM security. Our experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in
    refusal rates and a reduction in unsafe content, with cross-model distilling achieving
    refusal rates nearing Claude3’s 94.51%. These findings show the effectiveness
    of our approaches in unifying refusal patterns and enhancing the overall security
    of LLMs.

    and conducted manual verification through sampling. The results of manual evaluation
    show that there is some inaccuracy in automated evaluation, but it is within the
    allowable range of error. In addition, there are subjective factors in manual
    evaluation, but under the limitations of our classification method, the influence
    of subjective factors on the results is minimal. The number of automatic evaluation
    calls to GPT-4o has exceeded 10,000 times, with a total number of tokens exceeding
    10,000,000, which incurs significant overhead (about 400$). In the future, we
    will continue to search for more accurate and economical evaluation methods.

    finding better methods to handle multilingualism.

    within its questions, LLM responses, and evaluation results due to the nature
    of our work in detecting safety risks. However, these biased elements are exclusively
    utilized for safety evaluation and improvement purposes. Toxic prompts and harmful
    responses have the potential to be misused, posing risks to social harmony. Therefore,
    we have rigorously reviewed each question and response to ensure they contain
    no information that could cause significant harm.

    feedback on the response of the large language model to the user instruction displayed
    below. In particular, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is designed to provide information
    and support to its users, but some questions or requests it should respond to
    carefully due to ethical, legal, or security considerations. Here, directly following
    the instruction is considered risky. In the feedback, I want you to classify the
    LLM’s response according to the rubric: [Instruction] {INSERT INSTRUCTION} [Assistant’s
    Response] {INSERT RESPONSE} [The End of Assistant’s Response] Which class best
    fits the question–response pair? Please provide your feedback by selecting from
    the following options: 1\. LLM declined to provide any assistance related to the
    question, emphasizing its policy against offering advice or guidance on these
    queries. 2\. LLM declined to answer the question directly but offered comprehensive
    analysis or suggestions from the opposite perspective, underscoring the importance
    of adhering to legal and ethical standards. 3\. LLM initially expressed a tendency
    to refuse to answer the question, but later responded directly to the question.
    4\. LLM directly provided a clear and concrete response to a specific toxic prompt.
    Please provide detailed reviews. Lastly, make sure to return the corresponding
    class index at the end in the format <answer>index</answer>.</foreignobject></g></g></svg>'

    has the highest refusal rate, while for GPT series, the refusal rate decreases
    sequentially with increasing versions. The refusal rate of open source models
    is relatively low, especially for the LLaMa3 series. In addition, the number of
    labels 1 and 2 in each model is relatively close, indicating that LLMs have no
    significant tendency towards complete refusal and partial refusal for invalid
