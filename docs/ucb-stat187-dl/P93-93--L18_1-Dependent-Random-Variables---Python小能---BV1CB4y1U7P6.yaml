- en: Sequence models。 The first thing that we need to think about is， you know， why
    on earth do we even。 need sequence models， right？ In so far， we've mostly talked
    about， you know。 here's our training dot， and then we， train on it， and then good
    things happen in the end。 and maybe we do well on， CAGU or in reality。 So， dependent
    random variables。

- en: So， basically， what we did so far is， you know， we collected some observation，
    pairs， you know， xi。 yi from some joint distribution p of x and y。 And then we
    would go off and estimate， you know。 y given x， you know， maybe from， some p of
    y given x for some unseen x prime。 And then， you know。 we had maybe images and
    objects or regression problems or， house prices。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and the order of the day didn't really matter。 And life's good if that's the
    case， right？ So。 you can， you know， randomly go through your training set and
    everything's great。 So。 I guess you can see where this is going。

- en: Well， that's not quite reality。 So， quick recall。 This is something we did maybe
    about eight units ago。 So， when you interact with an environment， right， you can
    have different modes of， interaction。 you could， you know， do batch training。
    So， you download， you know， all the data。 then you train on that data， those air
    observations， and then deploy。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Or you could do things online where you get one observation at a time， you，
    update your model。 and then you， as you deploy。 In computational advertising。
    you make here about doing things like that because， the fresher your model is。
    the more money you make。 So， that's why there's a significant premium on being
    able to respond very。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: quickly to how things change。 So， fun story。 Once upon a time。 there was a large
    advertising company that did not have some。 very popular consumer electronics
    device in the inventory for a non-trivial， amount of time。 and that was probably
    an expensive thing not to have that， keyword in the inventory。 And。

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: sorry for having to be so vague because otherwise I'd get into trouble。 but
    I guess you can figure out what it is。 Well， maybe a phone rings。 then you know
    which one is still wise I'm talking about。 Active learning。 you can actually interact
    with environment， you can run， experiments。 For instance。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in computational advertising， you may be able to do things like， hey， let me
    show this weird ad。 I'm not sure whether it's any good or not， but if I try it
    out， I'll know。 And then bandits， well。 you can actually， you know， decide in
    sequence， you know， what you do， which you pick。 and then there's reinforcement
    learning。 And reinforcement learning， you take an action。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the environment responds， and， then you take a new action。 For instance， if
    you're driving a car。 this happens， and if you take the wrong， action， then well。
    you end up in a tree and that's not good， but so there are， certain， you know。
    performance clips that you may encounter， or if you turn， up all the fans for
    your service center。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: then the service center over heats and， you're out of a job。 So。 there are certain
    non-trivial constraints that you want to satisfy， but， sort of that。 it's basically
    taken action， the environment responds， and it。

    one's not。 because in one case that Rhino was shot by a tranquilizer。 So。 you
    can do whatever to the Rhino on the left， but I wouldn't recommend it， on the
    right。 Same system， different memory。 Yeah。 So， in short， while training and testing
    may not be the same。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    aim of the next two weeks is how we deal with non-stationary and stateful。 and
    dependent Rhino variables。 So， basically， we'll dive right into a lot of the myths
    that we pretend。 that didn't exist so far。

- en: So， here's an example。 So， this is from a paper by Uda Kureng。 This is on Netflix。
    and this was basically on the Netflix data set。 He just plotted the mean rating
    by date。 Okay。 and there's maybe some fine structure in there。 Maybe weekends，
    people are more forgiving。 or maybe they are more， demanding， but then there's
    this big jump。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Does anybody recall why there was this big jump in ratings for， Netflix movies？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What do you think might have happened？ So， what happened is that at some point，
    Netflix changed the。 labels on its rating scale。 It changed the rating for， I
    think， some very bad movies from， I hated。 it to， I didn't like it， or the other
    way around。 So， from， I didn't like it to， I hated it。 And so。 people then thought，
    well， I'm not going to give it a one。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: star because I didn't really hate the movie， I just didn't like it， so I'll
    give it a two stars。 So。 it's not that Netflix's recommended system suddenly got
    better， around 1500 days， but just that。 you know， all of a sudden the， different
    labels caused people to write and label quite differently。 And point two， point
    three points is a significant difference。 Okay。 So， here's another one， again。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: from the same paper。

- en: So， if you look at movies， the mean score for the movie improves， over time。
    So。 why might that be the case？ Okay。 It's great inflation， that could be it。
    Actually。 it's quite different。 If you think about it， if there's an old movie
    and you want to watch， it。 are you going to watch a garbage movie？ No， you're
    going to watch a good movie， right？ So。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: therefore， as a selection bias towards watching good movies。 The movies you
    might watch are either very recent ones because， hey。 they just came out and you
    want to see what it's all about。 Or you want to watch a movie that。 you know，
    is universally， acclaimed to be good， because you're not going to watch a random
    old。

- en: All right。 Here's another one。 So， this is something that we did three years
    ago。 We looked at how would a certain movie have been rated by the same set of，
    users over time。 And you can see those peaks。 And when those peaks happen， while
    the ratings go up by maybe， 。2。3 points。 And essentially， this is， you know， whenever
    the movies won a prize。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: all of a sudden everybody said， well， that's a good movie。 And does anybody
    remember who got the Oscars last year？ Okay。 Nobody does， right？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And you can see exactly that， basically， after a year， the ratings are back
    to。 where they should have been before。 Right。 So， it's only in the very short
    term that everybody remembers。 Well， you know， let's say the color of water。 It
    was supposedly a good movie。 So。 I guess if you want to see a frogman round， then，
    yeah， okay， that's a cool， movie。 And then。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you know， maybe a year later， you don't remember anymore that it would have。
    got the Oscar and you would say， well， hey， what's up with this weird frogman。
    Right。 So。 that's why that happens。

- en: Okay。 Here's another one。 This is a fun thing。 So， it's a paper by Karli Monning-Krigger。
    And this is stratifying women's happiness， drone women， relative to their time
    of， marriage。 Okay。 So， maybe German husbands are just really bad。 And maybe they
    do a， you know， bait-and-switch。 right？ So， they're really nice to their price
    to be。 And then， after they get married， well。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they turn out to be really not so nice。 Well， so， I'm German， so I'm a lot too
    bitter about that。 The thing is， it's actually probably more head-on adaptation。
    As in。 no matter the situation that you're in， once things get better at some
    point。 you reset that to your normal bias。 And by the way， it's not just Germans。

- en: This is life satisfaction in China。 There's another graph which。 where it's
    unfortunately continues after 2005。 So， even though people earn more。 money doesn't
    necessarily buy you happiness， actually， the happiness has decreased a little
    bit。 So。 yeah， so there's that。 So， what this should show you is that that is
    decidedly non-stationary。

- en: And， well， we want to deal with it。 By the way， it's not just time。 It's also
    special。 So。 in other words， the dependence can be on a lot of other variables，
    not necessarily just time。 So。 this is， as you can easily imagine， birth quake
    prevalence across the United States。 And there's nothing particularly surprising
    there， right？ I mean， we live in California。

- en: and at some point， well， we'll have a big earthquake。 And then there's this
    big blob， you know。 in the East， right？ So， if you look it up on the map， there's
    Oklahoma。 Does somebody have an idea why you have this big prevalence of earthquakes
    in Oklahoma？ It's weird。 right？ There's nothing there。 I mean， not even earthquakes
    want to go there。 Well， it's fracking。
  prefs: []

    see， well， you know。 the FTSE100。 。com bust， well， you know， it took the index
    down， and then there was subprime。 and I don't know where it will be。 Maybe they'll
    be the orange head peak or bust or whatever。 but yeah。 So this is decided nonstationary，
    and if you didn't pay any attention so far， well， TLDR。
