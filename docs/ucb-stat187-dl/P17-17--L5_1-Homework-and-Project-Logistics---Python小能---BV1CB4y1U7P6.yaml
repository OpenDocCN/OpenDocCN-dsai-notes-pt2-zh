    was due yesterday。 Okay。 Who has not registered for the， projects yet？ Okay。 So。
    I figured that that was what， I was going to happen。 So， you have time until。
    tomorrow to find a team and register for the project。 I see two hands up。 Yes。
    You first。 Okay。

    submitted the project by uploading a PDF with those， things to my -- so。

    make their， own。 email。 Okay。 So， thanks。 Who doesn't have a teammate yet？ Okay。
    Everybody who does not have a teammate yet， keep your hands up。 Okay。 So。 who
    has a team of size three？ Size three？ Okay。 You guys raise your hands。 Well。
  prefs: []

- en: raise them high otherwise。 Okay。 So， the thing is， if you don't -- if you have
    a small team。 here are some teammates， some prospective teammates， meet up， with
    them after the class。 Well。 you just -- if you have a， team of size four， likewise，
    take on some extra team members。 They all want to help。 They all want to learn。
    So， do that。 Yes。 The project title can change。 Yes。
  prefs: []

    to care。 So。 you can put as your project， title， watching paint dry。 Okay。 Now。
    I wouldn't recommend that because it's a little bit silly。 But this is really
    just to make sure that you even have a team。 Right？ Now， in one month from now。

    gets five minutes or four minutes of， embarrassment up here on stage。 Okay。 By

    okay。 So。 let me go over this。 So， for tomorrow， all you need is names and a project
    title。 And if you want to put a little abstract in there， it's good。 If not， it's
    also okay。 If you're short of ideas， that's， what the TAs and that's what Mu and
    I are good for。

    ideas。 Or talk to your friendly lecture， here at UC Berkeley who's maybe your
    advisor or you want to be。 advisor。 Right？ Or talk to some PhD students or some
    other fellow students。 Or just pick something really cool。 Right？ So， we can help。
  prefs: []

    the next month。 you want to get to more than， watching paint dry。 Within the next
    month， you want to。 have -- and this is what we'll be doing in four weeks -- a
    two-page， document up to two pages。 at least one page but no more than， two pages。
    That describes what you're going to do。
  prefs: []

    yet。 but at least some， idea of how you're going to approach it。 Okay。 Watching
    the paint dry。 Okay。 Fine。 Requirements。 Camera。 Video recording equipment。 Patients。
    Right？ Okay。 And then you want to have some idea of where you， for instance。

    equivalent of the pitch deck。 Right？ And you get two slides at most。 And yet。
    most get four minutes because we need one minute for， changing over。 Okay。 So。
    if you get more than that within the next four weeks， it's awesome。

    everybody gets busy。 And then in the end you have the end of semester madness，
    which， well， I guess means。 given that you're not only taking this， course， you
    will have to have madness from all the courses。 Don't do that to yourself。 Start
    early。 Okay。 I know we're all stress puppies。 We included。 So。

    want to convert notebooks， to PDF， you can go to stack overflow。 You look at this
    slide which says IPython in B convert to， PDF notebook。ipi in B。 This will give

    Okay。 So first of all， yes， apologies。 Math。jax is not quite Latex。 There are
    certain equation environments and so on that it， doesn't like。 There's not much
    you can do besides using stack， overflow which ones those are。 Secondly， so。
