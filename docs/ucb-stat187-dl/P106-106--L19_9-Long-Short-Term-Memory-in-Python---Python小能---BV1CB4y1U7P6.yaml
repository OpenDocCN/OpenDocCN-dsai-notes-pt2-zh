- en: So let's look at the LSTM code。 First thing is we load the data。

- en: And then we need to initialize the parameters。 And again。 the parameter initializer
    is the same as before。 Just that we have one extra set of weight vectors。 right？
    So again， we initialize two with normal Gaussian， plus 1， the bias being 0。 And
    they just have three groups of parameters， right？ The input gate， the forget gate。

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and the output gate， and the candidate cell parameters。 Let's block there。 Then，
    of course。 I need the outputs。 Here we go。 And so now I stuff everything together。
    And presto。 I get my parameters with the gradients attached。 And that's what I
    return。 So this is getting boring， right？ This is exactly the same code as what
    you've seen before。 Now。

- en: is we need to initialize the state。 And well， this does nothing else。 But just
    return。 in this case now， two vectors of 0s。 Why am I now returning two vectors
    of 0s rather than 1？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Exactly perfect。 So this is exactly-- we have a state， and we have the memory
    cell。 And both things need to be carried through。 So remember。 the memory cell
    is something that just sits there， and does things in the background。 I can't
    read it directly， but it still， needs to carry it with me。

- en: So here's where the magic happens。 So these are my parameters。 I just decompose
    it。 And this can be done nicely in Python。 And here now， I decompose my state，
    into hidden and memory。 Now， the outputs are empty again。 And now， this is basically
    just the LSTM math。

- en: So I have my three gates， IFNO， all nicely with sigmoids。 I have CTIL that has
    the candidate memory with a tangent。 That operates on everything， right？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You can see the green part of the bracket， being referring to all of that。 I
    then have the actual memory cell， by using the candidate and the corresponding
    forget gate。 And then here's the output。 And there we go。 And you just return
    this。 So this is really just verbatim what we had on the slides。 But just a bit
    more detail。

    of that is the same。

- en: And since we are a little bit out of time， as in actually pretty much out of
    time。 I'm not going to run the training run。 But what you would see if you were
    to run it for long enough。 is that it would work ever so slightly better than
    a GRU。 Yeah。 so now you're asking yourself how to do that in GLUON。

- en: Well， the only difference to what we saw before， is that now you don't invoke
    RNN。GRU， but RNN。LSTM。 And press the U-F-U-LSTM。 The other thing to observe is
    that this is slower。 So before that。 we had 0。3 seconds， and now we have 0。48。

- en: And here it's 0。9， rather than 0。7 or something like 0。8。 Basically， OK。 my
    laptop is doing something in the background， so it's slowing it down。 But basically。
    the time would have been about that。 And so you run this， and you get your LSTM。
    Good。 Now。 doing anything fancy beyond that， is what we'll cover next Tuesday。
    Then we'll go deep。

- en: We'll go bidirectional。 And we will probably get a little bit of a chance。 to
    look at word embeddings。 So thanks for today。
