- en: We present BioLunar, developed using the Lunar framework, as a tool for supporting
    biological analyses, with a particular emphasis on molecular-level evidence enrichment
    for biomarker discovery in oncology. The platform integrates Large Language Models
    (LLMs) to facilitate complex scientific reasoning across distributed evidence
    spaces, enhancing the capability for harmonizing and reasoning over heterogeneous
    data sources. Demonstrating its utility in cancer research, BioLunar leverages
    modular design, reusable data access and data analysis components, and a low-code
    user interface, enabling researchers of all programming levels to construct LLM-enabled
    scientific workflows. By facilitating automatic scientific discovery and inference
    from heterogeneous evidence, BioLunar exemplifies the potential of the integration
    between LLMs, specialised databases and biomedical tools to support expert-level
    knowledge synthesis and discovery.

- en: Contemporary biomedical discovery represents a prototypical instance of complex
    scientific reasoning, which requires the coordination of controlled in-vivo/in-silico
    interventions, complex multi-step data analysis pipelines and the interpretation
    of the results under the light of previous evidence (available in different curated
    databases and in the literature) Paananen and Fortino ([2019](#bib.bib7)); Nicholson
    and Greene ([2020](#bib.bib6)). This intricacy emerges out of the inherent complexity
    of biological mechanisms underlying organism responses, which are defined by a
    network of multi-scale inter-dependencies Bogdan et al. ([2021](#bib.bib2)). While
    more granular data is being generated by the evolution of instruments, assays
    and methods, and the parallel abundance of experimental interventions Dryden-Palmer
    et al. ([2020](#bib.bib4)), there a practical barrier for integrating and cohering
    this evidence space into a specific context of analysis.

    Language Models (LLMs) can provide an integrative framework for harmonising and
    reasoning over distributed evidence spaces and tools, systematising and lowering
    the barriers to access and reason over multiple structured databases, textual
    bases such as PubMed, enriching the background knowledge through specialised ontologies
    and serving as interfaces to external analytical tools (e.g. mechanistic/perturbation
    models, gene enrichment models, etc). In this context, LLMs can serve as a linguistic
    analytical layer which can reduce the syntactic impedance across diverse functional
    components: once an adapter to an external component is built it can be integrated
    and reused in different contexts, creating a monotonic increase of functional
    components. Complementarily, from a Biomedical-NLP perspective, in order to address
    real-world problems, LLMs need to be complemented with mechanisms which can deliver
    contextual control (e.g. via Retrieval Augmented Generation: RAG: access the relevant
    background knowledge and facts) and perform the analytical tasks which are integral
    to contemporary biomedical inference (’toolforming’).'

    software components with standardised APIs. A workflow is composed of components
    and subworkflows connected through input-output relationships, and are capable

    Synthesis and Scientific Reasoning Framework for Biomedical Discovery")). Creating
    a workflow does not require programming knowledge since components are predefined
    and merely require data inputs or parameter settings. However, for users who wish
    to write custom code, ’Python Coder’ and ’R Coder’ components are provided, enabling
    the definition of custom methods. These custom components can be saved and subsequently

    evidence and infer conclusions from bioinformatics pipeline results. Specifically,
    the biomedical workflow queries expert knowledge bases (KBs) that continuously
    compile clinical, experimental, and population genetic study outcomes, aligning
    them with assertions relevant to the significance of the observed gene or variant.
    It then employs Natural Language Inference (NLI) (via LLM) to integrate and harmonise
    the evidence space and interpreting the results, culminating in a comprehensive
    summary for the entire gene set input. This interpretation takes into account
    the bioanalytical context supplied by the user.

    of tumours and patients in experimental cancer treatments. NGS findings are essential
    to guide the design of novel biomarkers and cancer treatments. Nevertheless, the
    clinical elucidation of NGS findings subsequent to initial bioinformatics analysis
    often requires time-consuming manual analysis procedures which are vulnerable
    to errors. The interpretation of molecular signatures that are typically yielded
    by genome-scale experiments are often supported by pathway-centric approaches
    through which mechanistic insights can be gained by pointing at a set of biological
    processes. Moreover, gene and variant enrichment benefits from heterogeneous curated
    data sources which pose challenges to seamless integration. Furthermore, there
    are different levels of supporting evidence and therefore prioritising conclusions
    is crucial. Automating evidence interpretation, knowledge synthesis and leveraging
    evidence-rich gene set reports are fundamental for addressing the challenges in
    precision oncology and the discovery of new biomarkers.

    profiles (MPs), which are essential for the final interpretation. Additionally,
    users specify the analysis context, including aspects such as cancer types or

    by a prompt-based NLI component within this defined context. Subsequently, MPs
    scored below a predefined threshold (set at a MP score of 10) are tagged as less
    known, reflecting lower scientific evidence and ranking by CIVIC annotators. The
    evidence supporting these lesser-known MPs is then interpreted by a prompt-based

    set of specialised prompts-based Natural Language Inference can serve as the foundation
    for streamlining and automating complex analytical process within a biomedical
    setting. . We showcase analytical applications within the biomedical domain, particularly
    in oncology, constructively progressing towards more complex gene analysis workflows.
    The developed bioworkflow demonstrates the LLMs can be instrumental in enabling
    a complex end-to-end highly-specialised analytical workflow, in a reproducible
    manner, supporting the integration of heterogeneous evidence, synthesising conclusions
    and while simultaneously documenting and linking to the data sources within a
    comprehensive output report. The proposed workflow is based on a low-code paradigm
    that enables domain experts, regardless of their programming skills, to construct
    and scientific workflows enabled by generaqtive AI amethods.

    and hallucinations are possible. The current workflow is motivated by a hypothesis
    generation process, which is fully human supervised and does not have direct clinical
    applications.
