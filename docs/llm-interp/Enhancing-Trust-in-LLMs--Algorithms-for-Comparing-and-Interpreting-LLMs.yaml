- en: This paper presents a survey of evaluation techniques aimed at enhancing the
    trustworthiness and understanding of Large Language Models (LLMs). Amidst growing
    reliance on LLMs across various sectors, ensuring their reliability, fairness,
    and transparency has become paramount. We explore a range of algorithmic methods
    and metrics designed to assess LLMs’ performance, identify weaknesses, and guide
    their development towards more trustworthy and effective applications. Key evaluation
    metrics discussed include Perplexity Measurement, Natural Language Processing
    (NLP) evaluation metrics (BLEU, ROUGE, METEOR, BERTScore, GLEU, Word Error Rate,
    and Character Error Rate), Zero-Shot Learning Performance, Few-Shot Learning Performance,
    Transfer Learning Evaluation, Adversarial Testing, and Fairness and Bias Evaluation.
    We also introduce innovative approaches such as LLMMaps for stratified evaluation,
    Benchmarking and Leaderboards for competitive assessment, Stratified Analysis
    for in-depth understanding, Visualization of Bloom’s Taxonomy for cognitive level
    accuracy distribution, Hallucination Score for quantifying inaccuracies, Knowledge
    Stratification Strategy for hierarchical analysis, and the use of Machine Learning
    Models for Hierarchy Generation. Furthermore, we highlight the indispensable role
    of Human Evaluation in capturing nuances that automated metrics may overlook.
    Together, these techniques form a robust framework for evaluating LLMs, aiming
    to enhance transparency, guide development, and align assessments with the goal
    of establishing user trust in these advanced language models. In future papers,
    we will describe the visualization of these metrics as well as demonstrate the
    use of each approach on practical examples.

    technical metrics to encompass considerations of social alignment, transparency,
    safety, and trustworthiness. Liu (2023) stresses the significance of ensuring
    LLMs align with human intentions, adhering to societal norms and regulations.
    Liao (2023) advocates for a human-centered transparency approach, focusing on
    the varied needs of all stakeholders involved. Huang (2023) delves into the safety
    and reliability of LLMs, suggesting the adoption of Verification and Validation
    (V&V) techniques to mitigate risks and conduct thorough assessments. Karabacak
    (2023) highlights the unique challenges in the medical sector, calling for comprehensive
    strategies that include clinical validation, ethical considerations, and adherence
    to regulatory standards. Together, these perspectives emphasize the essential
    roles of transparency and trust in evaluating LLMs, especially for their application
    in real-world scenarios.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Perplexity Measurement serves as a fundamental metric in the evaluation of Language
    Models (LMs), including Large Language Models (LLMs), by quantifying their fluency
    and predictive capabilities. Sundareswara (2008) highlights its importance in
    assessing model fluency, emphasizing its role in measuring how effectively a model
    can predict a sequence of words. The methodology for perplexity estimation has
    seen various innovations; notably, Bimbot (1997, 2001) introduced a novel scheme
    based on a gambling approach and entropy bounds, offering an alternative perspective
    that enriches the metric’s applicability. This approach was further validated
    through comparative evaluations, underscoring its relevance. Additionally, Golland
    (2003) proposed the use of permutation tests for estimating statistical significance
    in discriminative analysis, suggesting a potential avenue for applying statistical
    rigor to the evaluation of language models, including their perplexity assessments.

- en: While perplexity is invaluable for gauging a model’s fluency, it is not without
    its limitations. Its primary focus on the probabilistic prediction of words means
    that it does not directly measure semantic accuracy or coherence, areas that are
    crucial for the comprehensive evaluation of LMs, especially in complex applications.
    This metric, deeply rooted in information theory, remains a critical tool for
    understanding how well a probability model or distribution can anticipate a sample,
    providing essential insights into the model’s understanding of language.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    of a sequence of words, given a language model. A lower perplexity score indicates
    a better performing model, as it suggests the model is more confident (assigns
    higher probability) in its predictions. Conversely, a higher perplexity score
    suggests the model is less certain about its predictions, equating to less fluency.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A range of NLP evaluation metrics, including BLEU, ROUGE, METEOR, BERTScore,
    GLEU, WER, and CER, are used to assess LLMs in various tasks (Blagec, 2022). However,
    these metrics have been found to have low correlation with human judgment and
    lack transferability to other tasks and languages. This raises concerns about
    the adequacy of these metrics in reflecting model performance (Blagec, 2022).
    Despite these limitations, LLMs have shown promise in radiology NLP, with some
    models demonstrating strengths in interpreting radiology reports (Liu, 2023).
    However, in domain-specific applications, such as Wikipedia-style survey generation,
    LLMs have exhibited shortcomings, including incomplete information and factual
    inaccuracies (Gao, 2023). Similarly, in medical evidence summarization, LLMs have
    been found to struggle with identifying salient information and generating factually
    inconsistent summaries (Tang, 2023). These studies highlight the need for more
    robust evaluation metrics and the importance of considering the limitations of
    existing ones.

    of Large Language Models (LLMs) within various NLP subfields. It seeks to offer
    an all-encompassing assessment of an LLM’s performance, highlighting both its
    strengths and areas requiring improvement, particularly focusing on reducing hallucinations—where
    models erroneously present incorrect information as accurate. Puchert (2023) underscores
    the value of LLMMaps in detecting performance discrepancies and susceptibility
    to hallucinations in LLMs. Complementing this, CRITIC, introduced by Gou (2023),
    enables LLMs to self-correct via interactions with external tools. Furthermore,
    Peng (2023) proposes enhancing LLMs with external knowledge and automated feedback
    to further curb hallucinations. Collectively, these strategies aim to bolster
    the precision and dependability of LLMs, marking significant progress in NLP technology.

    problems demanding extended reasoning and specialized knowledge. This benchmark
    has highlighted the advancements in newer LLMs, while also pointing out areas
    needing further development. Additionally, Vestal (1990) suggested a method for
    benchmarking language features through multiple sampling loops and linear regression,
    a technique that could offer detailed performance insights for various LLM parameters.
    Collectively, these approaches underscore the role of Benchmarking and Leaderboards
