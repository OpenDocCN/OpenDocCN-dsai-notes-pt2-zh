 We've talked about the democratization going on in machine learning。

 This is a theme that I've written extensively about with， Appur Saxena who is formerly with。

 Google and helped implement many of the AI initiatives there。

 and is currently the global head of AI at JP Morgan Chase。

 These articles that we have written are available as， optional readings as part of this course。

 I encourage you folks to take a look at it。 Now let's jump into a conversation with Appur。 Hello。

 joining me now is Appur Saxena， who is the global head of AI at JP Morgan Chase。 Appur。

 thank you for joining us。 If you can please introduce yourself and your background a little bit。

 >> Thank you， Karthik， for inviting me to this conversation。 As you said。

 I lead AI ML for JP Morgan。 I've been here almost one year and。

 I fundamentally believe that AI is very transformative for finance。

 This has been my theme for the last few years before this， for JP Morgan， I was with Google。

 where I run Google AI verticals team。 Essentially AI applied to healthcare， AI applied to finance。

 AI applied to industry。 We fundamentally believe AI is one common theme that runs。

 around transforming multiple industry。 I'm sort of making that happen at JP Morgan。 >> Great。

 In fact， on that note， I would love to hear about how AI is having an impact in financial services。

 Can you help give us a sense of the big picture in terms of how AI can be used and。

 is being used in finance？ >> If you look at finance historically has been a very technology driven industry。

 from all the way to ATM to even using digital banking。 It's very data driven industry。

 Two very fundamental thesis you need for AI to transformation is you have to have a lot of data。

 and it has to be digitized。 Those two sort of key ingredients have always existed in finance。

 The third piece that is very interesting is there's no agency problem that typically。

 exists in other industry for healthcare。 The people who own the data have huge incentive to monetize it。

 As a result of decision making process that is typically involved in any AI。

 transformation is very fast in finance。 So I think those three combination make AI in finance as industry very ripe for。

 disruption through AI。 And there are multiple things that are happening。

 AI is now being used to disrupt how you interact with the front office all the way to。

 the back office and can give you multiple examples of how that is being done。 >> Okay。

 so let's maybe start with the front office and how is front office meaning。

 how the company is interacting with the customer。 So tell us how it's changing。

 how financial services companies are interacting with customers。 >> So I think again。

 and front office， the most important thing is customer interaction。

 So AI is being used to sort of fundamentally transform a multi-channel， omni-channel experience。

 So whether you are talking to now， whether it's just going to an online website。

 you can have a conversation with your bank。 That's one area that is being transformed using advances in conversational AI。

 Better targeting， micro-targeting， using unique signals that typically。

 banks never use in sort of targeting their customer base。 And the third is personalization。

 Personalization has been there for some time， but， creating personalized financial products。

 as well as the area that is happening on the front side。 >> Okay。

 what do you mean by creating personalized financial products？

 So certainly we've talked about personalization in this course。 It's an important theme。

 not just in financial services， but， in retail and so many other settings。

 But it's also an idea that's been around for a while。

 So tell us a little more about personalizing the product itself。 >> That's a very good。

 personalization has been there for a long time。 And so personalization of messaging has been there for。

 long in terms of email， but email targeting， using the right language in your email。

 So that's exact， at targeting。 But what has happened in the last few years or。

 the last few sort of quarters is increasingly you're seeing products being created。

 One example is thematic portfolio。 So you can have a creative portfolio very unique to you based on your interest。

 Hey， I want to sort of invest in sustainable companies。

 I want to invest in companies which are targeting a particular region。

 So how do you sort of get to that without actually mining their SEC data？ Their filings。

 their investing relationship and， then coming up with a particular theme。

 So that's one example of how AI is being used to create thematic portfolio。 >> Interesting。

 you also mentioned AI is being used in the back office as well。

 So walk us through how AI is being used in back office settings。 >> So again。

 AI has been used in finance for a long time。 Traditionally， back office like fraud and AML。

 anti-money laundering。 So what has transformed， what is happening is some of the new deep learning。

 techniques are being used to create very complex fraud detection models。

 So it's the scale at which you can sort of manipulate data and。

 sort of use data and use new data sources。 That's what a huge transformation is happening。

 Same thing on AML。 Now this like for example， JP Morgan runs around one third of all transactions。

 that happen in the world through some way through JP Morgan。

 We are using real time extremely complex knowledge graphs to create insights and， alerts for fraud。

 So that's one example。 Other areas， traditional areas in call center。

 Rather than your IVR experience is completely， we transform using a conversational experience in cost customer。

 You can even have a experience conversation with your bank account in terms of how。

 much bank balance there is in the bank in your checking account。 And what you can do。

 you can do simple wire transfers now completely， conversationally without ever talking to a human being。

 So that's the kind of sort of back office operations that traditionally have been。

 done now getting transformed through AI。 Another example I should talk about is contracts。 So banks。

 a lot of back office operation in bank is associated with contract。

 negotiation and maintaining contracts。 So there's a lot of new sort of exciting stuff happening in terms of。

 machines understanding contract and then identifying discrepancies。

 alerting the relevant parties in a contract to sort of make take actions。

 So it's really great work going on in that area as well。 >> So poor as the global head of AI。

 clearly both you individually but your organization as a whole is investing， a lot in the AI。

 And when companies are investing a lot in the AI， the question is what are the things that need to be in place for。

 you to get returns out of it？ Because as we have seen。

 there are many companies that are investing in AI but not yet seeing the returns。

 So tell us how you think about this。 What is an AI strategy that you find works well and。

 is likely to produce returns in the long run？ >> And that's a very good point。

 I think one thing to note is it's very easy to get started in an AI。

 I think literally you can hire few data scientists。

 give them a laptop and they should be up and running doing AI or。

 doing machine learning or data science。 I think where you're hiding is how do you have huge impact。

 transformational impact in AI？ And I think there are three sort of ways we have seen that work across。

 One is you have to have the right infrastructure to do AI at scale。 And what does that mean？

 Essentially it means having your data in place。 Data easily discoverable， easily annotated。

 And then ability to train models， large scale models。

 So that's essentially what I call AI infrastructure and， Facebook， the Google。

 or the world invested heavily in this。 And that's the reason they have been able to leapfrog the industry。

 The second piece is you have to look at your business processes from。

 end to end perspective and see how AI can be applied。

 End to end to end process rather than a small piece of the overall process。

 And the third piece I would say you have to come up and。

 you can use AI and should use AI to create new digital experiences。

 And this is where you will see the most impact over time。

 >> What's an example of a new digital experience that you can create through AI？

 >> So I think AI has been unable to do， has been able to do amazing。

 sort of new experiences through conversation。 Speech to text accuracy has increased a lot。

 Ability to create new text， completely AI generated text has increased a lot。

 So now you can think of experiences that were just not possible two or， three years back。

 just two or three years back。 So the correct example。

 and if you're talking in the private world space， there are a lot of low touch。

 high frequency transactions that you typically， as a bank want to automate。 Example of hey。

 you wake up in the morning and， you want to check your portfolio。

 how is it doing and why is it down？ So hey， you wake up， talk to Alexa。

 one of the digital experiences assistant and， say， why is my portfolio down by two percent？

 And then the AI assistant goes and dissects your portfolio and。

 comes up with very good reasons of why it is down and， gives you that transaction。 Of course。

 in all this experience， if you want to dig deeper and go very deep。

 you actually call your wealth advisor。 But that's the kind of experiences that we're talking about。

 >> So it's certainly clear how you can apply AI to improve existing experiences。

 But when you talk about creating new experiences， what exactly do you mean？

 >> So AI has enabled a completely transformative transformation experience in。

 how you converse with machines and how you can generate new， text， machine generated text。

 So these two advances can be applied to transform how you interact with a bank。 So give an example。

 typically a low touch， high frequency interaction with。

 your private wealth advisor is typically something that bank want to automate。

 And an example of this is you wake up in the morning， you talk to your bank through， Alexa and say。

 hey， how is my portfolio doing today？ How did it do yesterday， in fact？ And it says， hey。

 it's down by two percent and then you start digging deeper into， hey， why is it down by two percent？

 It says this is how your portfolio is constructed and。

 this is the reason why it is down and so on and so forth。

 So that kind of interaction is very low touch， very high frequency。

 But something that you easily can automate it today and。

 that's the kind of experience that I'm talking about。 >> Well， there we have it。

 three pillars that approve of suggesting。 The first one being before we embark on big initiatives with AI。

 let's make sure the underlying infrastructure， the data infrastructure and， platforms are in place。

 The second is don't think about individual touch points alone， but， in fact。

 think about entire end-to-end processes and look at how AI can transform， that entire process。

 And lastly， use AI certainly to transform existing experiences， but。

 also think hard about how AI can create completely new experiences for。

 the customers and those can be strategic and game changers for the company。 Appurf。

 thanks again for joining us。 >> Thank you for having me。 [BLANK_AUDIO]。
