  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: And this is， again， because they can synthesize， any number of variables about
    a candidate。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to come up with good decisions or about an employee， to come up with good recommendations。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It also can discover new relationships， that we might not have known about before。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And one can imagine a number of new applications， of new data types that traditionally。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: have not been used in the HR process， that can now be integrated into a machine
    learning-based system。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So very granular data， perhaps on employee choices。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: or actions that can be integrated into this decision making。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One problem that this starts to surface， however， is related to data ownership。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So we're gonna talk about a peripheral problem， to machine learning that isn't
    directly a part。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of machine learning， but it's very related， to how effectively it can be implemented。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And this is related to data storage。 And we're gonna talk in particular about
    the blockchain。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: which is， of course， a technology， that has received a lot of attention。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in other contexts like Bitcoin， for example。 It turns out that blockchain also
    has potential in HR。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to address some of the issues around data ownership。 So AI solutions， of course。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: require massive amounts of data。 And again， there are potentially new business
    models。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and new applications that could arise， when using really fine-grained data on
    employee choices。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: or employee actions to predict whether they would be。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a good fit for the firm and how well they would perform， at the firm。 Similarly。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: applications for employees within the firm， to use very fine-grained data for
    their activities。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: or actions or tasks that they perform， to think about career path development
    and so on。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: At the same time， there's growing concerns everywhere。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: about the ownership of data and privacy of data。 It's a hot issue right now。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's not lucky to go away anytime soon。 Lots of concerns about who should be
    owning employee data。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: who should be owning private data， and how much control you should have over
    your own data。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So as we think about moving into a world， where machine learning makes more
    and more decisions。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and richer and richer data， the question arises， how do we store this data，
    who owns this data？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And this is where blockchain emerges， as a potential solution to this problem。
    It could address。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: at least， a part of this problem。 It's a way， blockchain is a way for any two
    parties。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to exchange information without the need for a third party， to own the data
    or to hold the data。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So whenever we're talking about exchanging， or providing information related
    to an HR process。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/addad62098853b8c6e6d4fe16c27e91d_3.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: we're often talking about having a third party， keep information or records
    safe for us。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But it's a credentialization or skill-based certificate。 If it's just a university。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: basically guaranteeing， that we have a degree from that university。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we have that third party that keeps data safe for us。 If it's a platform that
    we are learning on。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: or taking courses on， it might be a platform， that's keeping the data。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so there's a number of questions that are emerging， around where data is
    best stored。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is for a number of reasons。 One is that there are a number of regulatory
    issues。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that are emerging。 For example， those around the global data protection， regulation，
    the GDPR。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in the EU。 There's also potential for market failure。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: where we might think there are some types of data， that would be very useful
    for HR decision making。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but there's no business model there。 So maybe there's no company emerging。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that is willing to be the arbiter of that information。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So we can't always just rely on third parties， to be safe and effective owners
    of the data。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that's going to be used to broker HR decision making。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/addad62098853b8c6e6d4fe16c27e91d_5.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: in a machine learning pipeline。 So the blockchain can step in here， because
    what it essentially is。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: is a data storage technology that is immutable。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/addad62098853b8c6e6d4fe16c27e91d_7.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: So what I mean by that is that any information transactions， that are entered
    into the blockchain。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: cannot be changed once confirmed。 And that is fundamental to the design of the
    blockchain。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And therefore that information can be received as the truth。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so the implication of that is that with the use， of a technology like the
    blockchain。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it doesn't require any central authority。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/addad62098853b8c6e6d4fe16c27e91d_9.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: or owner for verification。 Generally speaking， when we have a set of data。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: think about bank information， we need a central authority or owner to verify
    that information。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to basically act as a guarantee or of trust， for that information。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The blockchain is a tool or technology， that is aimed at getting around this。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And this has the potential to be a data storage solution， that can tie private
    data together。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that can be useful for HR decision making， with AI based prediction。 In the
    next video。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we'll talk a little bit more。
