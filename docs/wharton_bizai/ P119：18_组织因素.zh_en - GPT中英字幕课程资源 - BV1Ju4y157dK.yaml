- en: innovation that the AI is best suited for。 But there might be also many other
    organization factors out there that may affect that precise。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: relationship。 So in this video， I'm going to talk about how you organize your
    innovation may mediate。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that relationship。 Some organization structures are just well suited to support
    AI driven innovation。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and， some organization structures are not。 So in this video。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we'll explore whether organizational factors such as how you organize， your
    innovation teams。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: team composition， and how the skill set of employees could change。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/7590a3e1649afd6f82298bd4671c58b1_3.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: the type of innovation that AI can help firms create。 In this video。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we'll focus primarily on the structure side。 Organizations have very different
    ways of organizing their activities。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They may organize their general activity in one way， and they may organize their
    innovations。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: another way。 So it's very important to look at specifically how firms are organizing
    their activities。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: innovation activities， and also how they compare to the general organization
    structures。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this structure can both vary within industries and also across industries。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/7590a3e1649afd6f82298bd4671c58b1_5.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: That means it's not just about industry differences。 For example。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: drug R&D may just organize very differently from automobile R&D。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Or it could be within the same industry that within drug discovery， one firm
    decided to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: organize their activity for innovation in one way， and another firm would choose
    a different， way。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So to give you an idea of what I'm talking about， let's see some examples。 These
    are two firms。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Google and Apple， and they organize their innovation activities， in a very different
    way。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: These two are very innovative firms in the technology sector。 And if you look
    at Google。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: their innovation structure is much more dispersed， whereas。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: on Apple is very much concentrated into a few clusters。 So what are these clusters？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What are the nodes？ What are the links in this graph？ So the nodes in these
    graphs are inventors。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Two nodes are linked when they wrote a patent together。 Okay？ So you can see
    Google。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they have a few clusters， but they're pretty much decentralized。 Whereas Apple。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you see the innovation structure really concentrated in a few clusters。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The big one is in the center， also another one in the bottom， where Google is
    much more， dispersed。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So this is a way how firm naturally organize themselves。 It could be many different
    reasons。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Could be historical reasons。 Could be different way of thinking about organizations。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: think about innovations。 So many factors， we don't really know why they organize
    them the way it is。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But that's not the most important points， but I just want to show you that firms
    organize。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: innovation differently。 And these structures once formed are actually difficult
    to change。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: because it's kind of， harder to change the innovation relationship。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a formal structure by fiat or changing the， CEO or changing the research R&D
    head。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's not necessarily going to change that structure quickly。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But analytics and AI are changing very quickly。 So can we see the adoption of
    AI analytics change these firms differently？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Can these technology help Google type of the world better or the Apple type
    of the world？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In a sense， can they help a more dispersed innovation structure more so than
    a concentrated。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: version or vice versa？ And this is not just the Apple versus Google because
    they are too famous firm and they。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: are both very innovative and maybe specific to tech sectors where very innovative
    firms。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You see the same thing in various other industries as well。 This is two firms，
    Cenofe and Roche。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: These are big drug makers。 Again， you see they're very productive drug makers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but these pharmaceutical companies， have very different ways of organizing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Cenofe is slightly more dispersed where Roche is much more concentrated in the
    future a。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: few clusters。 So similar question we can ask is that can a little bit of AI
    help the Google Cenofe of。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the world or Apple Roche of the world to innovate？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And they're pros and cons of centralization and decentralization。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are many advantages to decentralization in the sense that people are focusing
    on their。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: specific type of work。 They're very much local to their market and they tend
    to take sticky knowledge。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: By sticky knowledge， there are things you know and it's hard to move from one
    group。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to another because there are lots of tacit knowledge， lots of things you just
    know amongst。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: each other within a team but it's hard to translate that information to others。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And when people work together on a specific problem for a long time， they are
    more likely。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to identify problems and create autonomous solutions。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But because they are decentralized it's sometimes difficult to facilitate that
    cross group coordination。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They're very good at working with each other within a group but might be a little
    difficult。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to translate that knowledge or work with another group who may have very different
    way of communicate。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: with each other or different way of creating their own lingos or own sticky
    knowledge。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: On the other hand， centralization can also provide many advantages。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Centralization tends to create very radical innovation applicable beyond that
    individual， group。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the centralized world， you may be very good at identifying a problem， a solution
    of your。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: own group but your solution may just work for you but it may not work rightly
    across， all groups。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Or centralization can help you do that better。 And centralization also has broad
    search for external information beyond the individual。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: group that they may decide that certain resources， certain things are just better
    for the entire。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: organization as opposed to thinking about that individual group。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Individual group tend to think about， relatively， myopically， what is good for
    my group without。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: thinking broadly。 So centralization can overcome some of the cross department
    or the core nations that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: decentralization doesn't have but decentralization is really good at solving
    problem locally and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: then if I novel solutions specific to that business context。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So there are pros and cons in both cases。 So how do analytics and AI come in？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/7590a3e1649afd6f82298bd4671c58b1_7.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: Do you think analytics， knowing what you know about analytics is going to help
    centralize。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: organization better or decentralize innovation structure better？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you think about what analytics and AI can do， one of the key advantage is
    that they。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: can conduct broad search for diverse knowledge。 And they。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: by doing that broad search and finding that hidden pattern， hidden relationship
    that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you haven't seen before。 They're also linking existing silos of information
    in a way that helps decentralize structure。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So by having a tool that automatically， mine cross different fields and finding
    hidden patterns。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it can in some ways mitigate that central weaknesses of decentralization in
    terms of， coordination。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It can also solve all the coordination。 That's as impossible。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But even chipping a little bit of that difficulty that may facilitate these
    organizations and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: structures in performing in innovation activities。 And remember in our last
    video。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we showed that artificial intelligence， machine learning。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: hidden analytics are especially great at finding that new combination or new
    diverse combination。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: or new way of using existing technology， existing combination and new way。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And that is all going to be great for helping decentralize the structure and
    solving their。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: problem and says， "Oh， it seems like another technology invented somewhere else
    may be used。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to help me finding a solution to my problem。"， Again， if I mentioned earlier。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you think about cancer ontology， PPP3 protein， if you， think of new chassis，
    art music。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: these are all great new combinations by reusing， using。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: combination and new way or reusing existing technology and new way or finding
    a diverse。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: combination together。 And that essence can help decentralization by putting
    that silos of information and silos。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: technology and by combining them in a new way。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/7590a3e1649afd6f82298bd4671c58b1_9.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: So let's see if our intuition is correct。 So again。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we can measure the innovation structure of the firms。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So here we're using machine learning to understand machine learning。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Here we're using community detection algorithm on co-authorship network。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Basically what it does is capture how many groups are there in this graph and
    how connected。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they are to each other。 So in a very dispersed crowd in the Google world。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you'll see a very high measurement， of decentralization and the concentrated
    apples of the world you see a high value on。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: centralization。 And I want to make a note that this is different from formal
    hierarchies。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Number one， they're very difficult to capture。 And number two。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they may not reflect on what people are really doing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Just because you and you another person who has worked together many times before
    are。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: reworked into different organizations， doesn't mean you won't work with each
    other anymore。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You won't think about new patent file。 They may affect to some extent。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but it won't affect that dramatically。 So here we're actually capturing the
    real way people are working together。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the real。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/7590a3e1649afd6f82298bd4671c58b1_11.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: way people are innovating together。 So I'm looking at their co-authorship on
    a patent。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So this is the distribution of dispersion innovation。 So again。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the high value means you're very dispersed， low value means you're very concentrated。
    Again。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you see a huge spectrum of firms。 Some firms are very dispersed。 Some firms
    are very concentrated。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You see a spike of zero here。 I just prefer to never file any patent。 So we
    just。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that's zero by default。 But if you need more than zero column。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you see that dispersion is quite spread out。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/7590a3e1649afd6f82298bd4671c58b1_13.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: You can use this measure to gauge your own organization structure。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You can sort of see how your formal hierarchy of your structure， how that different
    from。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the informal collaboration structure was actually being done by the employees
    themselves。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And you can， because as you own firm， you don't need to just use public data
    such as， production。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you can look at trademarks， potter design teams， white papers， and publication。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they created together。 All of that can help you measure the actual internal
    collaboration structure of a firm。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And you can also see how this structure is different from your competitors。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You can look at your own patent co-authorship network。 That's your collaboration
    pattern。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And compare that with your competitors to see how you organize your activities
    differently。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/7590a3e1649afd6f82298bd4671c58b1_15.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: from competitors。 When you look at data analytics， and if you look at AI investment。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: these technologies， complement decentralized innovation structures in firms。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That means decentralized innovation structures benefit tremendously by having
    investment。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in AI and investment in analytics。 Not only are they more likely to adopt。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and when they do adopt both together， that means， they invest in both AI and
    they have decentralized innovation structure。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They're more productive， and the firm with only AI or only decentralization。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They are about 3% more productive。 And that's pretty big difference。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: considering how competitive these industries are。 And we look at the fact between
    the most recent years and the earlier years。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and that fact， is even stronger in the recent years。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That's firm learn to know about how to deploy in an analytics， any AI innovation。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But structures matter dramatically。 Data analytics and AI can help decentralize
    innovation structure。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And they can do that better than centralized structure。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/7590a3e1649afd6f82298bd4671c58b1_17.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: Okay， so I showed you that AI can support decentralization， better decentralization。
    Again。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: there are nuances to that。 It's not going to support all types of innovation。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's going to support a specific type of innovation， as I mentioned earlier，
    that is。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: combinations of existing things in a new way。 Recombination innovation。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: diverse combination innovation。 So again， I mentioned earlier that a new combination
    is something you combine existing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: technologies in a new way。 For example， in our earlier example， we have four
    technologies， A， B， C。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and A， B。 You can think about new combination will be B， C， combining B and
    C together， where a。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: diverse combination putting A， B， C together forming A， B， C。 Okay。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: so we can also classify them in a little different way in the sense that we
    can call， A， B， A， B。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: C new combinations that hasn't existed before。 Okay， or we can see A prime，
    B prime。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: C prime are just in our slight improvement or refinement， of existing technology，
    A， B， and C。 Okay。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: so A prime will be an improvement on A， B prime will be an improvement B， and
    C prime。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: will be an improvement on C。 Okay。 And again， we can also mention D， a brand
    new technology。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that hasn't existed before， or a new subclass in patent， it'll be D， it'll be
    a novel technology。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/7590a3e1649afd6f82298bd4671c58b1_19.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: So again we can classify innovation to three types。 Brand new technology would
    be like D。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Or a new combination， like an A， B， B， C， A， B， C。 Or reuse A prime B prime
    C， prime。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And we can benchmark the newness against globally， or locally to your firm。
    In a sense， we can say。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: are you the first average， to generate a technology called A， B， C？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And that has never existed in an entire world。 Or we can say。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: although I'm not the first to create A， B， C， but I first want to use it in
    my own industry。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You can say local to that particular firm。 So we can measure this three by two
    combinations， novel。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: new combination， reuse。 And each three can be applied globally and also。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: locally to the specific firm。 Whether it's new， it's global to the entire world。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and whether it's just local to that firm， to that industry。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/7590a3e1649afd6f82298bd4671c58b1_21.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: In this graph， I'm going to show you， how likely is it for AI investment。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to help decentralized innovation structure， to produce all different six type
    of innovation。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So when a firm had decentralization， and they invested in AI， what is the likelihood。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of trading a new global technology class？ That's the first graph。 Or a new combination
    globally。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Or a new combination locally to its firm。 Or are reusing of existing technologies。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I'll explain each one in term。 The first one is on new technology class。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So this is how we read this is that when a firm has decentralized。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: innovation structure and they invest in analytics， and they invest in AI。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: do that combination of decentralization， and AI investment help that firm create
    new global technologies。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You can see that the fact is almost negative。 But now look at the three graphs。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They're very-- this score is very high。 But notice what they are。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The second column is called new technology local。 So what does it mean is that
    it's a brand new technology class。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that this firm or industry hadn't seen before。 But that technology class is
    this elsewhere。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So again， you're incorporating a brand new technology class， like this elsewhere
    in the world。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and bring that into your industry， your own industry， and your own firm。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And the highest bar is actually called new combination， globally。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That means you combine technologies in a new way。 And that's the first time
    ever in the entire world。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that combination has existed。 And the slightly lower is new combination locally。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that this combination has happened in other industries， before。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But you're the first one to do it in your own firm， in your own industry。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So these three type of innovation， are the key to be benefited from AI and decentralization。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: On average， you look at the middle bar， on the highest bar， on new combinations。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: global combinations。 That's on average four patents per year。 In a sense， if
    you invest in AI。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: then you have decentralized innovation structure。 So if you have a decentralized
    innovation structure。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it seems to really pay off if using， AI to innovate patents that are a combination。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of existing technology together in a new way， or refinement of existing technology
    that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: has happened in other industries already。 Again， bringing outside innovation
    into your own firm。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in this three-year-old content in a new way， to solve the problem specific to
    you。 And next。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we see reuse。 Reuse are just think about A prime。 Basically， A prime is a slight
    improvement。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    the fact it's there。

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you probably don't need a heavy-duty AI technology， to help you do that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You probably know already what you need to do。 Because in here。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the search area around that technology， is relatively small， so it doesn't really
    benefit as much。
  prefs: []

    end。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of the components in the number of technologies。 So you have， say， 1，000 technologies。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you had to go through two to the 1，000， combination to figure out which one
    works。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That's a much bigger search space。 And that's where AI is really helping you。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: figuring out which combination is valid， which combination is not。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And that combination is especially powerful when， you have decentralized innovation
    structure。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: because that decentralized innovation structure really。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: needed the extra power of expanding a search space， that AI can provide。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Centralization doesn't need as much， because they already had ability to coordinate
    a search。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: broadly， to some extent。 But for decentralization， they precisely。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    analysis。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    class。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So in the prior measurement， we only， rely on the technology class that patent
    authorities allocate。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But here we can look at the citations。 If you believe your patents is very novel。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you should see that in some of the patent statistics。 So here we look at patent
    statistics。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in a sense that in the first one， bar will be 90 to 100。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It means 100% or 90% of the citation in your patent， are coming for your own
    firms。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So here is a entirely incremental of your own existing， innovation。 So 10%，
    it could be--。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I only said I cited 10% of my own patent， that firm's own， patent， and 90% are
    from outside。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So again， we did an analysis based， looking at AI investment decentralization。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That's what happens when you have both AI investment。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and you apply it on the decentralized innovation， structure。 What would outcome
    be？ Again。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you see that's really the middle range between 40， to 60 range that see the
    greatest being of buck。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And it says that you are not borrowing entirely， from new from outside， but
    borrowing just enough。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You cited just enough。 You utilize existing technologies， and you cited just
    enough from outside。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: not combination in the middle range。 This intermediate novelty seems to be the
    sweet spot for AI。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to help decentralized organization structure to innovate。 You notice on the
    very， very new ones。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: on the very 0% and the very right-hand side of the graph， again， you see a negative
    effect。 Well。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []

- en: It's probably because that when it's something so new。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you may not be able to know how to use it well。 When it's half and half， you
    sort of。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: know exactly how to apply it some way， to fit your own needs and context。 Once
    it's brand new。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: completely new， you just bring them outside。 That doesn't seem to be as effective。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: than doing the middle range。 And productivity effects， again， we see the same
    thing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We see that when you invest in AI， and having decentralized innovation。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you are much more productive。 And this is the effect even stronger in the reason
    years。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So in the first bar is for all years。 And the second bar is from 1988 to 2007。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And the third bar is 2008 to 2013。 You see the biggest effect is really。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: from the reason years between 2008 and 2013， where you see the biggest improvement。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: about 3% more productive。 That is firm that adopt AI and have decentralized
    innovation。
