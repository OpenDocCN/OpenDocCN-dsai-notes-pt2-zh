  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: especially in the last 10 years。 On one hand， the corresponding strategies should
    be well。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If AI skills matter for innovation， we should hire more people with AI skills，
    especially。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: AI skills for researchers who are at the heart of innovation and activities。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We're hiring a drug innovation expert and we're also really well-versed in AI。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That's probably pretty hard to find and if you find them， it's probably very
    expensive。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: If so， where would you put them？ So what does it matter to have inventors who
    have AI skills？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Or it doesn't matter， you can hire any AI skills and they can help the researchers
    to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/edf1ff9bb0d87a9872122d5a96ee4b08_7.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: use AI for discovery。 So we actually look at this precisely。 In our research。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: here we looked at inventors who also have AI skills。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We also look at the general non-inventors who also have AI skills in the firm。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We look at which type of employees contribute more to AI output and AI productivity。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Interesting you see that， you know， on AI skills and inventors， it's large but
    it's very。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and also very high。 So we can't really tell the fact of that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But the good news is that if you look at the AI skills for non-inventors， it's
    a pretty。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: strong effect， almost as large as the inventor with AI skills， but it's much
    stronger in。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/edf1ff9bb0d87a9872122d5a96ee4b08_9.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: So the good news is that you don't need to hire people with AI skills who are
    also inventors。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/edf1ff9bb0d87a9872122d5a96ee4b08_11.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: goals。 So okay， good news that you can hire AI skills broadly。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It doesn't have to be people who are in research who have strong skills in both。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Should AI skill be concentrated in a single department or should they be embedded
    within。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: different functional departments？ This is an interesting question because IT，
    traditionally。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: information technology departments， are often concentrated in a single department。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: managed by CIO or managed by a head of technologies。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And that's generally how firms manage their IT resources and IT departments。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Should a same configuration apply for applying or managing AI skills？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Or should firm decentralized AI skills embed them into specific functional teams，
    specific。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: product teams， specific functional departments？ Well。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: this is not an obvious answer to have because firms tend to do this both ways。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/edf1ff9bb0d87a9872122d5a96ee4b08_15.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: For example， Twitter first centralized their AI skills in a single department，
    just like。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you know how you organize IT skills。 And they created many interesting tools
    and products and they believe that these tools。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: can help teams at Twitter。 Unfortunately， most of these products team actually
    did not find the tool that these。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: AI， the centralized AI teams have created to be very useful。 So after a few
    years。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Twitter decided to decentralize their team by embedding AI skills。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: within the functional teams to help each product reaching their goals using
    AI。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/edf1ff9bb0d87a9872122d5a96ee4b08_19.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: And this is not just for tech companies， general electric， also experienced
    something similar。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: On a conversation with the head of research at general electric， the person
    told me that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it's actually most optimal for general electric to pair an industry expert with
    someone with。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: high data and AI skills to jumpstart their product innovation。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/edf1ff9bb0d87a9872122d5a96ee4b08_21.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: The industry experts can provide intuition and expertise in providing enough
    context and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: problems that are relevant to the company。 People with AI skills can help the
    person solve the problem。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: figure out what data to， use， how to implement it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So this is very important to have a contextual knowledge。 AI is a general purpose
    technology。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It can be used to solve the problem， but you need to define a problem well。
    So at first， again。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: GE has centralized AI skills and they find it not to work very well。 The solution。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the product they develop is beautiful， but again， they're not very useful， for
    their product teams。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So later， GE also decentralized their configuration by pairing the expert with
    a person with AI。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: skills。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/edf1ff9bb0d87a9872122d5a96ee4b08_23.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: So we actually look at this phenomenon more detail。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So this is just specific to GE or specific to Twitter。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We actually looked at the dispersion of data skills across seven functional
    groups。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: These are functional groups are typical in those offerings。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We looked at the manufacturing department， engineering， sales and marketing，
    human resources。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: being number four， five accounting and finance， six R&D， and seven administrative。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So these seven functions that's often occurring in all firms， we looked at how
    data skills。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: are dispersed across the seven groups。 And we looked at both within the street
    and also across industry comparisons。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/edf1ff9bb0d87a9872122d5a96ee4b08_25.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: And we looked at generally how this is distributed。 Again。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we service about 600 firms and look at dispersion questions and their corresponding。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: survey responses as a following。 The question is to what extent do you use data
    analytics in each of the following groups？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We asked them to say frequently or not frequently for each of the seven functions。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And we also looked at globally， all firms globally or just US firms， just European
    firms。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and just Asia firms。 You can't see there's a huge heterogeneity in across different
    countries。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: across different， regions of the world。 So it's not very obvious that data skills
    should be dispersed and data should be concentrated。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/edf1ff9bb0d87a9872122d5a96ee4b08_27.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: And this is dispersion scores by industry。 So basically， if you have very high
    dispersion score。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that means your data skills are distributed， quite evenly across seven functions。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you're just dispersion scores very low， that means you're highly concentrate
    your。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: data skill in a single or one or two departments。 So this is a median data dispersion
    score by industry。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We'll look at various industries out there when classified into each。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The highest being the management of companies and enterprises， 86。4% of these
    firms are having。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a highly dispersed score， meaning that data skills are highly dispersed across
    different。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: functions within the firm。 We see healthcare and social systems industry having
    a very low score。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: meaning that their， skills or AI skills are still relatively concentrated into
    a few departments。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/edf1ff9bb0d87a9872122d5a96ee4b08_29.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: There's definitely industry differences。 And this is the cluster of scored by
    region。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You can see that for data dispersion in the middle column， you can see that
    Europe is actually。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: more dispersion in the US and APAP is APAP is about the middle。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You can also see the other type of data related capital， the right hand side
    data related human。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: capital， they're pretty much the same across regions。 And you can see data decisions。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Europe is being a little high and the US being a little low。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There's definitely cluster of scores by regions and across different industries。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And if you look at these scores， the average may be the same。 The variance of
    them is very。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: very large。 So it shows you there's definitely a heterogeneity。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: People haven't figured out exactly how to organize the data skills yet。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/edf1ff9bb0d87a9872122d5a96ee4b08_31.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: So we actually look at this phenomena and we examined to what extent is dispersion
    actually。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: beneficial for firms。 So we actually find that our canonical example with Twitter
    and general electric is correct。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in a sense that when firms disperse their AI and their skills across different
    functions。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: meaning by embedding them into different functions or product teams， these firms
    are。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/edf1ff9bb0d87a9872122d5a96ee4b08_33.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: far more effective or far more productive than firms that did not do this。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/edf1ff9bb0d87a9872122d5a96ee4b08_35.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: On average， a one center deviation above the mean and dispersion score are have
    about。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 3-5% higher enterprise value。 And given the size of those firms in a sample
    and 3-5% change enterprise value for a medium。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: firm in our sample， so 3-5% change of $10。7 billion is between 320 to $534 million。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/edf1ff9bb0d87a9872122d5a96ee4b08_37.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: So this is a substantial change。 So again， percentage rise may be low but translating
    into a large number。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One percent， three percent， five percent is a huge。 [ Silence ]。
