  type: TYPE_IMG

    what we mean。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: by investment grade and speculative grade。 Remember。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: this line right here that I'm sort of hovering over， the line between triple。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: B minus and double B plus on the standard and pours or Fitch rating scale or
    between。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: B double A three and B single A one， that line demarcates investment grade，
    which corresponds。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to all companies rated above that line and speculative grade， which corresponds
    to all。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: companies rated below that line。 So that's what we're trying to do。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/f55d0fdfe2103fad83b74bff262d1d4d_9.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: Now we could be much more precise and develop a model that classifies ratings
    at the individual。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: notch level。 So we could distinguish but in theory between triple A and double
    A plus。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We could write down a model that distinguishes between every single one of these
    individual。
  prefs: []

    try to allocate to。

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: Now the question is， you know， how are we going to measure success？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: How do we know if our model is doing a good job？ And it's not as easy as you
    might think。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So put differently， what's our null hypothesis？ Let's hypothesize here。 One
    hypothesis is that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you know， we have a model that does better than just flipping， a coin。 In other
    words。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: every time we see an observation that can be either investment grade or speculative，
    grade。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we can always just flip a coin。 Hopefully our model does better than that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/f55d0fdfe2103fad83b74bff262d1d4d_17.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: But imagine the following model。 Imagine a model that predicts for every single
    firm。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and we're going to be talking about， firms at different points in time。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/f55d0fdfe2103fad83b74bff262d1d4d_19.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: So let's think about firm year observations， right？ For example。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Intel in 2014 or AAMD in 2017 or 2018， et cetera。 Let's imagine a model that
    just predicted investment grade all the time。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So if we predict that every firm firm year observations， since we'll be following
    firms， over time。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but if we， if every single one of our predictions is that the firm we're observing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: is investment grade， the accuracy rate for classifying investment grade firms
    will be， 100%。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Of course， the accuracy rate for classifying speculative grade firms will be
    zero。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We'll get every single one wrong because we will classify those speculative
    grade firms。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: as investment grade。 Now on the one hand， you might look and say， well， we got
    every。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we got 100% right on the， investment grade firms。 On the other hand。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we got none right of the speculative grade firms。 And so this really comes down
    to clearly。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: clearly defining success。 And in this context， and most classification context。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that breaks down to what are the costs， of the different types of errors that
    you can make。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So let's bring this together into a visual so we can talk about it a little
    bit more clearly。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So take a look at the slide and each box on the slide。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Each row corresponds to an actual observation in the data。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/f55d0fdfe2103fad83b74bff262d1d4d_21.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: So every single firm year observation that we'll have in the data， such as Intel
    in 2014。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: or AMD in 2018， whatever it is， will either be speculative grade or investment
    grade。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/f55d0fdfe2103fad83b74bff262d1d4d_23.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: That's the actual classification。 Our model is going to predict either speculative
    grade or investment grade。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so there's four possible actual predicted combinations that we can see，
    right？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We can correctly predict a speculative grade firm that is get what's called
    a true negative。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Or we can correctly predict an investment grade rated firm， a true positive。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/f55d0fdfe2103fad83b74bff262d1d4d_25.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: Now as I said， there's two types of errors。 We can either incorrectly predict
    speculative grade for an investment grade firm。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: or we can， incorrectly predict investment grade for a speculative grade firm。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/f55d0fdfe2103fad83b74bff262d1d4d_27.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: Now I just said with that naive model of always predicting investment grade，
    we can。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: make our true positive rate 100%， right？ But we're never going to get any of
    the speculative grade classifications correct。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/f55d0fdfe2103fad83b74bff262d1d4d_29.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: So what we need to think hard about is what is the cost of making these two
    errors？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/f55d0fdfe2103fad83b74bff262d1d4d_31.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: If they're both the same， if the cost of incorrectly classifying a speculative
    grade。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: firm is investment grade is the same as the cost of incorrectly classifying
    an investment。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: grade firm is speculative grade， then we just want to balance the two errors，
    right？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Or equivalently the two accuracy rates， the accuracy rates for both classifications。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/f55d0fdfe2103fad83b74bff262d1d4d_33.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: If on the other hand it's particularly costly to make one error relative to
    the other， then。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we're going to want to put weight on models， more weight on models that avoid
    those costly， errors。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: All right， let's make this concrete with an example。 Open your bank and your
    lending money。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/f55d0fdfe2103fad83b74bff262d1d4d_35.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: Now if you incorrectly classify a potential borrower as investment grade when
    they are。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in fact speculative grade， that can be very costly because you're not going
    to make enough， money。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You're going to give that firm very relatively loose terms on the loan， a low
    interest rate。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: maybe loose covenants， so that you are more likely than not to lose money on
    that loan。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/f55d0fdfe2103fad83b74bff262d1d4d_37.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: Whereas if you classify an investment grade firm as speculative grade， well
    the loss there。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: assuming they take the loan， isn't so bad， right？ Because you'll be charging
    a relatively high interest rate to a safe firm。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/f55d0fdfe2103fad83b74bff262d1d4d_39.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: You're going to make more money。 Now of course there's the argument that if
    you try and do that you won't get the business。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in the first place and there's a cost to that as well。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/f55d0fdfe2103fad83b74bff262d1d4d_41.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: But one might think that mischaracterizing risky firms as safe could be particularly。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: costly for a lender over any significant amount of time or significant number
    of deals。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/f55d0fdfe2103fad83b74bff262d1d4d_43.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: In which case， the box we're particularly concerned about is are these false
    negatives。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We do not want to inaccurately characterize or classify speculative grade firms
    as investment。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: grade firms。 So we really want to tamp down on those errors。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/f55d0fdfe2103fad83b74bff262d1d4d_45.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: For example， but of course， it's not that there are no costs here if we just
    start charging。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: every safe borrower that comes through the door with really high interest rates。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/f55d0fdfe2103fad83b74bff262d1d4d_47.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: No one's going to want to borrow from us。 All right。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So it's just an example to illustrate that there are relative potentially different
    costs。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: associated with different types of errors。 So which model is a success really
    depends upon what your objective function is。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: which， needs to be clearly articulated before you start the modeling process。
    In other words。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we need to answer this question。 What is success？ Very clearly and precisely
    upfront before we dive into the modeling so we know what we're。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: trying to accomplish。 All right。 So let me let me let me summarize this。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Our goal is to try and develop a model that distinguishes between investment
    grade and speculative。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: grade。 Success in our example is going to be one that minimizes both errors。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/f55d0fdfe2103fad83b74bff262d1d4d_49.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: We're not going to assign more or less weight on any individual layer。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We're going to see how well we can accurately classify both speculative and
    investment grade。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/f55d0fdfe2103fad83b74bff262d1d4d_51.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: That's going to be the goal。 That's where we're headed。 All right。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
