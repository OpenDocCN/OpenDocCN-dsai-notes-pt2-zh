  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: how do we decide which machine learning algorithm to use for any given task？
    Now in practice。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we evaluate different machine learning methods， by looking at their performance
    on what's called a validation dataset。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now given a large training dataset where you have input and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: output labels for all the entries in this training dataset。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the idea behind validation is to partition the dataset into a training dataset。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and a holdout which will be used for validation。 We train our model on the training
    dataset and once the model is trained。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we will use that trained model to make predictions on the holdout dataset。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We then evaluate how accurate are the predictions。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So if the predictions are more accurate with one model than another。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: then that's the model that we prefer。

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: Another variant of this approach is what's known as cross-validation。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The idea behind cross-validation is to take a dataset and， to create multiple
    partitions of it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example， we might create 10 partitions of the dataset available。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We might then initially set aside Partition 1 as our validation dataset。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and use Partitions 2 to 9 in order to train the model and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we test the model on the Partition 1 which was our initial validation dataset。
    Next。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we might use Partition 2 as our validation dataset and， we might train our model
    on Partitions 1， 3。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 4， 5， 6 and so on。 And then once the model is trained， we evaluate its performance
    on Partition 2。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We would repeat this a large number of times with each small validation dataset。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And that is essentially the idea behind cross-validation。 Ultimately。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the common theme here is that given a large training dataset。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the goal is to create some Partition or a holdout out of it so。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that we train the model on the rest of the data and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we evaluate its performance on a holdout dataset which was not used to train
    the model。 Lastly。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: another important question is whether a company should be investing in。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: better data or better machine learning models。 Both are valuable investments
    but in practice often we find that data beats methods。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There was a research study done by Microsoft researchers Banco and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Brill where they evaluated the performance of many different machine learning
    models。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: for a language understanding task。 They created several training datasets for
    multiple different machine learning models。

- en: In some cases， the machine learning models had access to a very small dataset。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: with only about say half a million words。 In other cases。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a machine learning model had access to large datasets with。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: up to a billion words in the training dataset。 When they evaluated the performance
    of these different machine learning models。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they found that the performance differences between the different machine。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: learning methods or the machine learning algorithms were relatively small when。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: compared to the difference between the same algorithm with more versus less
    data。 In short。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: giving a reasonable machine learning algorithm lots of data was better。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: than giving a good machine learning algorithm very little data。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is something that Google's computer scientist Peter Norvick often。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: refers to as the unreasonable effectiveness of data。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What this suggests is that a good starting point for。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a company is to really think through the data assets and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: think through whether we have high quality data in order to make our prediction
    tasks。

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: better machine learning model for the task at hand， but generally it all starts
    with the dataset。
