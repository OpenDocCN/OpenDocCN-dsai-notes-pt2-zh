    card fraud。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    these kinds of。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And in speaking to the banks， it became obvious that this was important proprietary
    data that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: learning algorithms can often be relatively small compared to the performance
    difference。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: what was more important in many settings was having access to the right。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: kind of data and having lots of that kind of data to train these machine learning
    algorithms。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    usually have。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: I'm going to discuss five different strategies that can be used to solve this
    chicken and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    product that generates the data one needs。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/ecc4564d566f7b37860fe82ecd8ee9e0_5.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: So creating a non-AI product or service that solves customer problems can help
    generate， the data。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That data can then be used to train an AI system that either enhances the existing
    product。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: or service or helps create a completely new but related service。 For example。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: let's look at Facebook。 Today， Facebook is a very heavy user of AI。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but Facebook didn't start by using AI because， they didn't have the data to
    do that。 Instead。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the social networking platform was focused on solving a different problem which。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: is helping people connect。 But once that platform was built， a lot of data was
    generated。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This data was then used to train AI systems that help predict what kinds of
    information。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: people want to consume， which in turn helped personalize the news feed on Facebook
    and。
  prefs: []

- en: Similarly， let's look at the insurance tech company Lemonade。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Lemonade is a user-friendly insurance product。 Lemonade didn't start by having
    the data to build the AI systems。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They instead built a product that was very easy for consumers to use and once
    they had。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: enough consumers， now they had the data that could be used to build the AI systems。
    Over time。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they're using AI to create insurance quotes。 They're using it to process claims
    in an automated fashion。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: detect insurance fraud in， an automated fashion。 According to the company， today。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the first notice of loss for 96% of claims are actually， managed by AI。 Similarly。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: claim resolution for a number of insurance claims are handled without human。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: involvement with AI systems。 This is an interesting example where even though
    the vision was always to build a company。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that uses AI and reimagines what insurance looks like， they started with a simple
    product。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/ecc4564d566f7b37860fe82ecd8ee9e0_9.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: that did not use AI but then slowly got in and added new AI capabilities once
    they had。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: enough users and they broke the AI flywheel as a result。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    the data you。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: need。 For example， you might be able to partner with companies that have the
    data but lack。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the AI expertise。 This is particularly useful if it is difficult to create a
    product that generates the kind。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of data you need。 For example， suppose you need medical data from patients and
    it's hard to get that kind。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of data and it's hard to break into that AI flywheel and it's useful in those
    instances。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to partner with companies。 For example， recently Google and Stanford Medicine
    have partnered together where they。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: take data of patients from Stanford's hospital and they combine it with Google's
    cloud and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: their AI capabilities to solve important questions in healthcare settings。 For
    example。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: one of the things they're doing is looking at alarm data， basically alarms。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: coming in hospital settings and to be able to distinguish between false alarms
    from real。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: ones that require attention and this can be very valuable in hospitalized patient
    settings。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: where you need to monitor the patients and so on。 Now pitfall with this approach
    is that potential partners might prefer to work with established。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: large tech companies like Google as opposed to smaller companies。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is where it's important to identify the right kind of partner and also
    to think creatively。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example， you might be able to get data from a family business and be able
    to leverage。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that to build new AI products and services。 A third strategy is to crowdsource
    the label data that you need。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are many settings in which data are available but it is not well labeled。
    For example。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a massive data set of images might be available but these images might not。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/ecc4564d566f7b37860fe82ecd8ee9e0_17.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: For example， consider Google's use of captures。 This is where we look at images
    and label what's in the images in order to be able to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: access a website for example or to verify that we are actually humans who are
    trying。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to access a website。 This serves an important security purpose but at the same
    time。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Google is able to use， this to simultaneously crowdsource a large number of
    images that then can be used for。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: other machine learning tasks。 As a product manager。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it's also useful to ask how do we create workflows which allow。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: customers to help label new data in the course of using the product so that
    it's not a distraction。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: for the user but actually they can be helpful in creating the label data we
    need。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/ecc4564d566f7b37860fe82ecd8ee9e0_19.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: For example， consider a cyber security product that generates alerts and it
    has a workflow。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in which an operations engineer might resolve those alerts by labeling which
    alerts are real。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and which ones are a false alarm really。 And in designing such a workflow。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we are automatically getting the label data that allows us to then。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: build a machine learning product that can automatically resolve these kinds
    of alerts。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Really consider music recommendation services like Pandora and others where
    users can provide。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: feedback on recommendations like a thumbs up or a thumbs down。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That again allows the system to get the label data which then in turn allows
    the ML algorithms。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to improve over time。 Another strategy available is to make use of publicly
    available data。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    can。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    available datasets。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG

    we should look。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    learning。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    supervised。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: machine learning which requires large training datasets， there are many other
    approaches to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    with large training。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: datasets instead they learn by taking actions and observing what happens。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In fact Google built an AI called AlphaGo to play the strategy game of Go and
    that system。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: was able to beat world champions of Go。 Later Google built AlphaZero which was
    an AI system with zero training data。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    diseases I would interview。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a large number of experts， doctors and ask them about rules they use to diagnose
    diseases。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and I would create an AI system that codifies these rules。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Such an expert system is unlikely to perform as well as a supervised machine
    learning system。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    supervised。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    carefully developed strategy around data。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: management， data collection and data labeling。 However when data access is a
    bottleneck that shouldn't deter a company from embarking on。
