- en: I think of course what's important is within an organization， how do we get
    success？ Well。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a large part of that success is depending upon how the structure for analytics
    is set。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: up within the organization。 So let's take some examples and try to understand
    different types of structure and what can。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: be some good takeaways in terms of how organizations can become more structured
    for getting the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: best out of analytics。 There are many different kinds of models out there。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The big takeaway I wanted to have as we go through these models is of course
    there's no。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: one size fits all。 You have to see what the maturity within the organization
    is in terms of what model might。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: work best for you。 I'll go through all of these models。 So let's start with
    the centralized model。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: then we'll go through the center of excellence。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/05b4558aaf13efad1ada829374260d2c_3.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: the functional model and finally the dispersed model。 So when you go through
    these models。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: let's look at the pros and cons and then I would， urge you to start thinking
    about your own organizations and the level of maturity that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it has as to what type of structure you feel will best go for your organization。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let's start with the centralized model。 The idea here is that there's a core
    unit of analytics that serves the entire company。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Of course， what are the advantages of this？ Many advantages。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The ability to work on cross-functional projects for example， of course there's
    a core unit。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that serves the entire company， they can see all kinds of analytics going across
    the entire。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: company。 What's happening operations， what's happening in marketing， what's
    happening perhaps in。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: finance。 This way you can share ideas across analysts who are working in different
    parts of the company。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And of course， the fact that there is a central unit which is serving the entire
    company， lots。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of analysts that are in there， there's a high level of dependability for the
    entire。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: company as well。 Clearly， it's a big structure that in some sense helps the
    whole company。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What are the flip sides？ The flip side is there might be a lot of workload and
    time constraints depending upon how the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: analysts are set up， depending upon the investment that the company has made
    in terms of the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: number of analysts。 Of course， given that there is one core unit。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: sometimes you might end up prioritizing the， projects that come to marketing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: sometimes operations and so on。 And another big disadvantage so to speak is
    agility。 Again。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: if there's one big unit， it's much harder to be agile because you're handling，
    many。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: many different projects at the same time。 Let's take another model。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's called the center of excellence model。 It's a very interesting combination。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The term that is typically used in the industry is called COE， center of excellence。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's an interesting combination where activities and analysts are based in their
    business units。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but there is a small core group as well。 What is the idea here？ In some sense。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you're trying to have the best of both worlds。 What that means is there is a
    central group of people in the small organization。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: central， group。 On the other hand， analysts being embedded in the business units。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they also have business， knowledge as well。 So substantive knowledge。 So what
    are the positives？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Training is centralized because the central group is handling all the training。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There's also good coordination as well。 On the flip side， what are the negatives？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The negatives might be the COE， the center of excellence， may not have enough
    control because。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it's a much smaller group。 And of course， the fact that it's a smaller group。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: how much signal do we have within the， organization that there is a lot of support
    for it？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Then there's a model， what I call the functional model。 I think it depends again。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we'll talk a little bit more about the maturity of the organization。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but the idea here is the following。 Analysts are typically based within the
    functions that dominate the analytics activity。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now for example， it's possible that the finance group within your company has
    a lot of different。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: things going on or the operations group， whatever the case might be。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So the company may decide the operations group let's say because there are a
    lot of。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: activity going on， that's where analytics should be concentrated。 Well， on the
    positive side。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: analytics is concentrated where it can benefit the most。 So you can look at
    the ROI。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you can do all kinds of things which can help you understand。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: how good is analytics and the practice of analytics for your company。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Where are all the different things， the new technologies that you're adopting，
    where are。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they having benefit？ What's the negative？ The negative is other functions may
    not get the support that you want。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So marketing for example， let's say， is not getting the support because a lot
    of the analysts。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: are within quote unquote the operations area。 And finally， this is a model but
    not really a model。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's called the dispersed model。 The idea is basically analysts are spread throughout
    the organization with no central。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: support。 And unfortunately for many organizations， I see this as well。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What's the positive if there is some？ Is that well。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: some units get it because they just happen to have analysts。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But I think there are many disadvantages。 First of all， this is not really a
    model。 In some sense。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you can think about little kind of sparks in different parts of the organization。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but not enough to catch fire。 And so in some sense。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: there is no real one way in which the dispersed model can hope to， get structure
    around it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But this is where I see a lot of organizations so I wanted to bring it up just
    so that you。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: realize that if this is where your organization is， it's time to start thinking
    about how。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you should change the structure of analytics in that organization。 Now of course。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a quick question and a big one is which model to use then？ We've talked about
    different models。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the CUE model， the functional model and so on。 Well， honestly。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it depends on the needs of the organization。 And in some organization。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: what I've seen is as they become more mature， initially when， they start。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you need some amount of centralization because you do want to understand what
    are。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the activities that are happening across the organization in terms of marketing，
    operations。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and so on。 What can in some sense be leveraged in one part of the organization
    that might be happening。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in other part of the organization？ So you do need some kind of centralization。
    On the flip side。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I think， you need to constantly monitor。 The model that you have in your organization
    is congruent with the maturity that you have。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So what I've seen in the best organizations that are more mature， they do have
    some centralized。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: kind of structure， the CUE type structure， but at the same time， they have analysts
    embedded。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/05b4558aaf13efad1ada829374260d2c_5.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: within the functional units。 Why？ Because I think for analysts， it's very。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: very important to understand the substantive nature。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of the decision making that's happening within the organization。 So this way。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: when analysts are building their models， when analysts are adopting new technology，
    to help。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: quote unquote， within their own businesses， they understand what the decision。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: makers are going through。 They understand the kind of hurdles that decision
    makers within the company are having when they。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: go ahead and use new technologies。 So start looking at your organization and
    see where you are in the level of maturity and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: then see what kind of model best works for you。 [BLANK_AUDIO]。
