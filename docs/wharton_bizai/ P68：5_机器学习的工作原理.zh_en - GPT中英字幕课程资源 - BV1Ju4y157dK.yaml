- en: We talked about human decision making and rule-based systems where a software
    developer can put someone's expertise into software。

- en: Machine learning changes this paradigm a little bit。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So machine learning is essentially pattern recognition。 Machine learning does
    is it uses examples。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We call this training data to generate a decision framework。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The key is that machine learning is really all about showing not telling。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So instead of a person explaining how they do something。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: what you do is you provide lots and lots and lots of examples。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And the machine itself learns how the decision framework is put together。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And this completely changes the workflow。 It starts with the data not codifying
    the expertise。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is the key to machine learning is instead of providing a set of rules instead
    of providing guidelines based on expertise。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You just provide lots and lots and lots of data that serve as examples to the
    machine learning algorithm。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/743cf325b01b9308dcd18bd2fd3d01eb_3.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: And the computer arrives at an optimal mapping。 So for example。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: instead of providing a lot of information about what factors or what variables。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let's say we have a lot of information about candidates that are applying to
    the firm。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Instead of providing expertise or providing a lot of information about what
    a particular organization values in candidates and how to think about evaluating
    different factors or prioritizing different candidates。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What you might do instead with a machine learning system or building a machine
    learning system is provide a tremendous amount of data on historical data on applicants。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And these different factors， the different pieces of the applicant portfolio。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And the final decision that was made about the candidate。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So imagine you have this kind of data where you have lots of information about
    the candidates。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And then you have information about what decision was finally made on the candidate
    whether they were brought in for an interview or not。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the second case here when we have this data the machine learning algorithm
    can learn just from looking at the data how they should think about or how it
    should think about。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Or how it should think about waiting the different pieces of the applicant portfolio。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Whether it should prioritize prior employer experience， certain skill sets or
    so on。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You never had to tell it。 A human expert never had to tell it exactly what matters
    for that particular organization or context。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: From the data from being shown examples it can learn what to do。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So this is the difference between machine learning and some of the systems or
    some of the approaches that have been used before。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So this is a transformative development in a number of different ways。 And why
    is that the case？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Why is it that we think about the use of examples this way as being transformative？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Why is it we think about machine learning systems being transformative？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Number one is it changes the workflow。 An example of a rule based system which
    we talked about we need access to an expert。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We need human expertise at some point in the process。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And that can be expensive especially with really specialized highly trained
    experts。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It can be difficult to get that expertise and again it can be difficult to ask
    experts like that to explain everything they know about a body of knowledge or
    an application。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the machine learning case I don't need an expert I need the data generated
    by the expert so maybe I can walk over to in a medical case I can walk over to
    a hospital and get data on prior decisions or prior medical predictions made by
    practitioners。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If I have that I no longer need access to the actual expert。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's also transformative because there are some cases where you have so much
    data that there's really no way a human expert can do a robust job at synthesizing
    all of that information together。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So the examples we've been talking about we've been talking about a few different
    pieces of a portfolio but there are many machine learning cases or many information
    cases from information context where you have not three or four variables but
    thousands of variables that are informing a prediction。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the advertising space in the finance space sometimes in the environmental
    space for instance you may have thousands and thousands of variables in the notion
    that a human expert can really consider all of that information in one shot to
    arrive at a prediction it's a little ambitious but a machine learning algorithm
    can do a pretty good job。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you give a two thousand variables and you have those examples of what the
    final outcome was the algorithm in this case can do a pretty good job and often
    a much better job than a human can who might just find it very very difficult
    or impossible to synthesize all of that information at once。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's also transformative because of scale obviously once we have the algorithm
    built we can then run it at scale we can doesn't matter if it's looking at ten
    resumes a hundred resumes a hundred thousand resumes or ten million resumes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's pretty invariant to that so once we have this up and running it scales
    very very well。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's also very consistent which is a nice feature of systems like this because
    it is an algorithm it tends to arrive at the same decisions given the same information
    it doesn't get tired throughout the day it doesn't start to make mistakes on Sundays
    relative to others it's very consistent。

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: In some context this really matters。 The key to all of this the key to be able
    to build these systems and to achieve these benefits is all in the training data
    these examples that you feed the system to build it and that's what we're going
    to talk about in the next video。
