- en: Given a set of variables， machine learning algorithms are meant to allow the
    algorithm to learn a mapping。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: between these input variables and whatever it is that the algorithm is meant
    to predict。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So imagine you have a column of variables or several columns of variables and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you're trying to use these to predict some type of output。 But what about unstructured
    data， right？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's the big revolution in prediction really has been around predicting from
    unstructured data。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/332ae0adff6d9a7441d962d49313dedc_3.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: So think about things like online reviews or sound or pictures and images。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: How does data like that get converted into columns that can be then used to
    predict。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: some kind of outcome？ How do you pull out information from that unstructured
    data。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: convert it into something that could fit into a spreadsheet for instance， and。

- en: '![](img/332ae0adff6d9a7441d962d49313dedc_5.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: then use that to predict？ When data are not structured， when they're unstructured。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: like online reviews for， instance， you have to go through a process called feature
    engineering。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Features have to be engineered from the data。 And what that means is you take
    the unstructured data and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you basically create or code individual features from that unstructured data。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is a time consuming and often fairly challenging process。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And often requires also a fair amount of domain expertise。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is one of the most difficult parts in many ways of the machine learning。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: process and it's where data scientists really tend to spend a lot of their time。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It can really be as much of an art as a science。 So let me give you an example。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let's say the task at hand was to use pictures from real estate listings to。

- en: '![](img/332ae0adff6d9a7441d962d49313dedc_7.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: predict house values。 So lots of pictures of house of a house of the different
    rooms in the house of the yard。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: maybe even of the neighborhood。 And you want to use the data in that picture
    to generate some kind of a prediction。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of the house values。 So what you have to do is take these images， these individual
    images。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and extract individual features or data you might use。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: variables you might use to be able to predict how much is the house。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: how much the house is really worth。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/332ae0adff6d9a7441d962d49313dedc_9.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: So if we're taking these images and extracting features you might care about。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: when thinking about real estate value， this will require a number of different
    types of knowledge。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's not just a software development task because you would also need to know。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: what a realtor knows about things that matter。 What are you looking for？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What are you looking for in terms of rooms， in terms of the layout。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in terms of the lot and lot style， right？ And so all of those sorts of things
    require kind of a combination of knowledge。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So if you think about feature engineering， in this case。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it would require the knowledge of a realtor。 It would also require a software
    developer。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They could work together to try to pull these things out of the images。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to sit down together and say， okay， let's write something to pull out。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: relevant aspects of these images that might matter for predicting house value。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But there's a good amount of guessing involved。 It's a time consuming task。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And you're very likely to miss critical features that ultimately do matter。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: for predicting house value。
