 Hi， I'm Prasana Thambay。

![](img/99cede32118ee82da76132341daa4039_1.png)

 I'm a faculty member at Wharton in the OID Department。 The OID Department。

 that stands for Operations， Information， and Decisions。

 My personal area of interest is the economics of technology and labor。

 And one of the areas that includes is how AI is being used in HR systems and in hiring。

 In that process， I've worked with a number of companies that serve as labor market intermediaries。

 and that are at the forefront of thinking about how algorithms are used in the HR process。

 I've enjoyed working with a number of data science teams as well that wrestle with questions。

 around HR data and what it can help us predict。 When thinking about how data science。

 how AI are used and going to be used in HR， it's， useful to think about machine learning as a way to take data and to algorithmically arrive。

 at what you might call a prediction。 Now， when I say prediction， in the HR context。

 this also corresponds to just saying a recommendation。 So for instance。

 should we invite a candidate for an interview or not？ As you know。

 it's becoming cheaper than ever to apply to jobs and so HR screeners are often。

 inundated with applications and so machine learning tools are becoming very valuable for。

 recommending or predicting whether a candidate would be a good interview candidate。

 You could also think about a prediction or recommendation in the sense of promoting an， employee。

 You shouldn't be promoted or not。 Should a particular benefit be recommended or not to an employee？

 So the goal is always going to be to use the data to make a prediction of some sort。

 So we want to be able to eventually is to answer the question what context， what decision。

 context are really suitable for machine learning predictions and why？

 What makes them suitable and what might some of the trade-offs be when we think about using。

 machine learning for these types of applications？ Now， to do so。

 it's useful to understand a little bit about how machine learning works。

 And I find it's useful to think about as we talk about how machine learning works， it's。

 useful to think about a progression from what you might call human decision making to machine。

 learning。 So you might think about a progression that moves from human decision making to the use。

 of rule-based systems。 We'll talk about what that means shortly。 And then machine learning， finally。



![](img/99cede32118ee82da76132341daa4039_5.png)

 So let's talk about talking about how people themselves make decisions。 So when we make decisions。

 we use our knowledge and experience to develop heuristics。

 And this is especially true in environments where information is imperfect。

 We're often asked to make rapid decisions。 We don't have all the information we need。

 HR is a great example。 Again， HR or screeners or recruiters are seeing more and more applications for a given。

 job opening a given listing。 You can never know everything you want to know about a candidate。

 And so we use the experience and the knowledge we've gained in the past， the heuristics we've。

 developed over time to decide whether or not a candidate might be a good fit for the organization。

 One way to think about this type of decision making process is as a tree。

 This is a common way to think about decisions is as a decision tree。

 So there are a number of factors that we might weigh when thinking about whether or not a。

 person or we might want to elevate a resume to the top of the staff。

 We might be looking at different factors in the person's application。

 It might have to do with what school they went to。

 It might have to do with a prior experience or prior employers。

 It might have to do with skills or some kind of cultural fit that we're looking at in their。

 application。 With these different pieces of information form a tree。

 We might say if they went to a particular school in a particular program， we know that。

 they have good training in a particular area which is going to suggest the person might。

 be a good fit for the organizational role that you're trying to fill。

 So imagine you had a stack of resumes to evaluate and think about the tree that you might create。

 What factors would it include？ If you think through that。

 it may depend on various factors that are unique or idiosyncratic。

 to your organization or your particular knowledge of the position you are trying to fill。

 It might depend on specific things at the organization that you're working for or looking。

 to care about deeply when it looks for new candidates。

 So this requires in the role of an HR screener， requires experience related to hiring for。

 that specific organization。 It relates to maybe prior experience hiring for that specific role。

 This is the way things have been done generally in the past and it's a good method but there。

 are drawbacks of this approach。 When we have people who are using their prior knowledge。

 prior experience to develop heuristics， to hire people for an organization， it's time consuming。

 Obviously for the amount of time it takes a person to move through a stack of resumes。

 like that is very time consuming。 It's also again noisy and imperfect。

 Even though the knowledge experience we've gained over time is extremely valuable， it。

 can't capture the entire state of the world。 It can't capture everything about the market of applicants that we're seeing。

 And of course， applicants change and signals change。

 It's impossible or very difficult at least to capture all of that and incorporate that。

 into our decision making。 And then as people， people always have biases。

 And so these are some of the drawbacks to the approach where people using their knowledge。

 and experience develop various heuristics to make decisions。

 In the next video， we'll start to focus on what are called rule-based systems which start。

 to address at least one of these issues and starts to get at the others as well。

 Thanks for watching。 [BLANK_AUDIO]。
