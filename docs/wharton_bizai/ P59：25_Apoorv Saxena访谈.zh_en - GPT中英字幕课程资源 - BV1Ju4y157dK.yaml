- en: We've talked about the democratization going on in machine learning。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is a theme that I've written extensively about with， Appur Saxena who is
    formerly with。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Google and helped implement many of the AI initiatives there。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and is currently the global head of AI at JP Morgan Chase。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: These articles that we have written are available as， optional readings as part
    of this course。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I encourage you folks to take a look at it。 Now let's jump into a conversation
    with Appur。 Hello。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: joining me now is Appur Saxena， who is the global head of AI at JP Morgan Chase。
    Appur。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: thank you for joining us。 If you can please introduce yourself and your background
    a little bit。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '>> Thank you， Karthik， for inviting me to this conversation。 As you said。'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I lead AI ML for JP Morgan。 I've been here almost one year and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I fundamentally believe that AI is very transformative for finance。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This has been my theme for the last few years before this， for JP Morgan， I
    was with Google。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: where I run Google AI verticals team。 Essentially AI applied to healthcare，
    AI applied to finance。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: AI applied to industry。 We fundamentally believe AI is one common theme that
    runs。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: around transforming multiple industry。 I'm sort of making that happen at JP
    Morgan。 >> Great。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In fact， on that note， I would love to hear about how AI is having an impact
    in financial services。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Can you help give us a sense of the big picture in terms of how AI can be used
    and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: is being used in finance？ >> If you look at finance historically has been a
    very technology driven industry。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: from all the way to ATM to even using digital banking。 It's very data driven
    industry。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Two very fundamental thesis you need for AI to transformation is you have to
    have a lot of data。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and it has to be digitized。 Those two sort of key ingredients have always existed
    in finance。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The third piece that is very interesting is there's no agency problem that typically。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: exists in other industry for healthcare。 The people who own the data have huge
    incentive to monetize it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As a result of decision making process that is typically involved in any AI。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: transformation is very fast in finance。 So I think those three combination make
    AI in finance as industry very ripe for。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: disruption through AI。 And there are multiple things that are happening。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: AI is now being used to disrupt how you interact with the front office all the
    way to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the back office and can give you multiple examples of how that is being done。
    >> Okay。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: so let's maybe start with the front office and how is front office meaning。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: how the company is interacting with the customer。 So tell us how it's changing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: how financial services companies are interacting with customers。 >> So I think
    again。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and front office， the most important thing is customer interaction。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So AI is being used to sort of fundamentally transform a multi-channel， omni-channel
    experience。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So whether you are talking to now， whether it's just going to an online website。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you can have a conversation with your bank。 That's one area that is being transformed
    using advances in conversational AI。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Better targeting， micro-targeting， using unique signals that typically。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: banks never use in sort of targeting their customer base。 And the third is personalization。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Personalization has been there for some time， but， creating personalized financial
    products。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: as well as the area that is happening on the front side。 >> Okay。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: what do you mean by creating personalized financial products？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So certainly we've talked about personalization in this course。 It's an important
    theme。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: not just in financial services， but， in retail and so many other settings。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But it's also an idea that's been around for a while。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So tell us a little more about personalizing the product itself。 >> That's a
    very good。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: personalization has been there for a long time。 And so personalization of messaging
    has been there for。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: long in terms of email， but email targeting， using the right language in your
    email。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So that's exact， at targeting。 But what has happened in the last few years or。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the last few sort of quarters is increasingly you're seeing products being created。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One example is thematic portfolio。 So you can have a creative portfolio very
    unique to you based on your interest。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Hey， I want to sort of invest in sustainable companies。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I want to invest in companies which are targeting a particular region。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So how do you sort of get to that without actually mining their SEC data？ Their
    filings。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: their investing relationship and， then coming up with a particular theme。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So that's one example of how AI is being used to create thematic portfolio。
    >> Interesting。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you also mentioned AI is being used in the back office as well。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So walk us through how AI is being used in back office settings。 >> So again。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: AI has been used in finance for a long time。 Traditionally， back office like
    fraud and AML。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: anti-money laundering。 So what has transformed， what is happening is some of
    the new deep learning。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: techniques are being used to create very complex fraud detection models。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So it's the scale at which you can sort of manipulate data and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: sort of use data and use new data sources。 That's what a huge transformation
    is happening。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Same thing on AML。 Now this like for example， JP Morgan runs around one third
    of all transactions。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that happen in the world through some way through JP Morgan。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We are using real time extremely complex knowledge graphs to create insights
    and， alerts for fraud。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So that's one example。 Other areas， traditional areas in call center。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Rather than your IVR experience is completely， we transform using a conversational
    experience in cost customer。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You can even have a experience conversation with your bank account in terms
    of how。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: much bank balance there is in the bank in your checking account。 And what you
    can do。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you can do simple wire transfers now completely， conversationally without ever
    talking to a human being。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So that's the kind of sort of back office operations that traditionally have
    been。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: done now getting transformed through AI。 Another example I should talk about
    is contracts。 So banks。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a lot of back office operation in bank is associated with contract。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: negotiation and maintaining contracts。 So there's a lot of new sort of exciting
    stuff happening in terms of。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: machines understanding contract and then identifying discrepancies。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: alerting the relevant parties in a contract to sort of make take actions。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So it's really great work going on in that area as well。 >> So poor as the global
    head of AI。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: clearly both you individually but your organization as a whole is investing，
    a lot in the AI。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And when companies are investing a lot in the AI， the question is what are the
    things that need to be in place for。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you to get returns out of it？ Because as we have seen。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: there are many companies that are investing in AI but not yet seeing the returns。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So tell us how you think about this。 What is an AI strategy that you find works
    well and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: is likely to produce returns in the long run？ >> And that's a very good point。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I think one thing to note is it's very easy to get started in an AI。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I think literally you can hire few data scientists。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: give them a laptop and they should be up and running doing AI or。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: doing machine learning or data science。 I think where you're hiding is how do
    you have huge impact。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: transformational impact in AI？ And I think there are three sort of ways we have
    seen that work across。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One is you have to have the right infrastructure to do AI at scale。 And what
    does that mean？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Essentially it means having your data in place。 Data easily discoverable， easily
    annotated。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And then ability to train models， large scale models。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So that's essentially what I call AI infrastructure and， Facebook， the Google。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: or the world invested heavily in this。 And that's the reason they have been
    able to leapfrog the industry。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The second piece is you have to look at your business processes from。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: end to end perspective and see how AI can be applied。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: End to end to end process rather than a small piece of the overall process。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And the third piece I would say you have to come up and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you can use AI and should use AI to create new digital experiences。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And this is where you will see the most impact over time。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '>> What''s an example of a new digital experience that you can create through
    AI？'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '>> So I think AI has been unable to do， has been able to do amazing。'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: sort of new experiences through conversation。 Speech to text accuracy has increased
    a lot。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Ability to create new text， completely AI generated text has increased a lot。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So now you can think of experiences that were just not possible two or， three
    years back。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: just two or three years back。 So the correct example。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and if you're talking in the private world space， there are a lot of low touch。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: high frequency transactions that you typically， as a bank want to automate。
    Example of hey。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you wake up in the morning and， you want to check your portfolio。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: how is it doing and why is it down？ So hey， you wake up， talk to Alexa。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: one of the digital experiences assistant and， say， why is my portfolio down
    by two percent？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And then the AI assistant goes and dissects your portfolio and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: comes up with very good reasons of why it is down and， gives you that transaction。
    Of course。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in all this experience， if you want to dig deeper and go very deep。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you actually call your wealth advisor。 But that's the kind of experiences that
    we're talking about。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '>> So it''s certainly clear how you can apply AI to improve existing experiences。'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But when you talk about creating new experiences， what exactly do you mean？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '>> So AI has enabled a completely transformative transformation experience
    in。'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: how you converse with machines and how you can generate new， text， machine generated
    text。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So these two advances can be applied to transform how you interact with a bank。
    So give an example。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: typically a low touch， high frequency interaction with。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: your private wealth advisor is typically something that bank want to automate。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And an example of this is you wake up in the morning， you talk to your bank
    through， Alexa and say。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: hey， how is my portfolio doing today？ How did it do yesterday， in fact？ And
    it says， hey。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it's down by two percent and then you start digging deeper into， hey， why is
    it down by two percent？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It says this is how your portfolio is constructed and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: this is the reason why it is down and so on and so forth。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So that kind of interaction is very low touch， very high frequency。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But something that you easily can automate it today and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that's the kind of experience that I'm talking about。 >> Well， there we have
    it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: three pillars that approve of suggesting。 The first one being before we embark
    on big initiatives with AI。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: let's make sure the underlying infrastructure， the data infrastructure and，
    platforms are in place。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The second is don't think about individual touch points alone， but， in fact。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: think about entire end-to-end processes and look at how AI can transform， that
    entire process。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And lastly， use AI certainly to transform existing experiences， but。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: also think hard about how AI can create completely new experiences for。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the customers and those can be strategic and game changers for the company。
    Appurf。
