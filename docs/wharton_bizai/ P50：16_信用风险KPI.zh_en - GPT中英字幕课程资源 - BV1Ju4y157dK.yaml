  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I'm going to build up to them by first talking about how to assess credit risk。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So the way I want to do this is let's look at some data。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/8220f29f67036c49e3dc203b17865495_1.png)'
  prefs: []

- en: Admittedly small and simple data， but data nonetheless。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What I have here on the screen are the P&L and the balance sheet for Intel Corp。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I think this is their fiscal year in 2014。 It's just some historical data to
    illustrate some of the concepts I want to discuss。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And let's start by looking at their P&L， their income statement here。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You can see they had a little over $55 billion in revenue。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They had operating income in excess of $14 billion。 And net income or earnings
    of about $10 billion。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So from a credit risk perspective， just looking at their P&L， we can see that
    this is a fairly。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: profitable company， but that doesn't necessarily imply that they're capable
    of repaying all。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: their financial obligations since we don't know what they are。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So let's take a look over at their balance sheet and see what kind of obligations
    they， have。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now they've got some non-financial debt， things like accounts payable， which
    we're。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: going to ignore just for the time being。 And we're going to focus on the financial
    obligations。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: most notably the short-term debt， and debt due。 So that's debt that is coming
    due within a year。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: either because it has a very short maturity， something like commercial paper。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: or because it's long-term debt that is just coming up， on its maturity。 So a
    little bit over $1。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 6 billion of short-term debt。 And they've got about $12 billion of long-term
    debt。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So a little bit over $13。7 billion of financial debt。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What's interesting is they actually have $14 billion of cash and short-term
    investments。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So of course it's not literally sitting in a savings account in some bank， but
    it's in。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: short-term liquid assets that are easily converted into cash。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So looking at sort of a very high level at both their income statement and balance
    sheet。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a first glance would suggest that Intel is not a particularly high-risk firm
    when it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: comes to repaying its financial obligations in light of how much cash it's sitting
    on。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: as well as it's just its earnings， its annual earnings。 But this is very loosey
    goose。 Again。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I'd like to move towards something that's a little bit more formal。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So why don't we take a look at some key performance indicators as they relate
    to credit risk。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/8220f29f67036c49e3dc203b17865495_3.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG

    this table。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: right here， if you will。 Now let's start with some liquidity ratios because
    arguably most solvency problems begin。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: as liquidity problems， not that every liquidity problem turns into a solvency
    problem。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But the importance of liquidity for default is well known and well understood。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So let's look at three ratios that attempt to capture the liquidity position
    of a firm。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And I'm talking about the current ratio， the quick ratio and the cash ratio。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So let's start at the top。 The current ratio and I've got definitions over here
    in this column， A。G。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The current ratio is just a ratio of current assets。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That is all the assets the company has that can be easily converted to cash
    within a year。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: divided by current liabilities， which are all the liabilities or all the money
    it owes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: within a year。 Now that ratio is 1。73， which can be interpreted quite simply
    as follows。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Well has $1。73 of current assets for each dollar of current liabilities。 That
    is $1。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 73 of liquid assets that it can easily convert into cash to pay off each dollar。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of liability that it owes over the next year。 Now that seems pretty good。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So it's got more than enough assets to cover its liabilities。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But of course this notion of current assets being easily converted into cash，
    not all。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: current assets are the same。 And so the quick ratio acknowledges that by booting
    from the numerator inventory。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So it just considers cash and accounts receivables。 So once we boot inventory，
    our quick ratio。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: well the current ratio， net of inventory comes， down from 1。73 to 1。15。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So we've got cash and accounts receivables， $1。15 for each dollar of current
    liabilities。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And then if we really just focus on cash， we've got 88 cents of cash for each
    dollar of current。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: liabilities。 So mechanically these numbers are going to decline because we're
    moving more and more。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: from the numerator and we're removing it in a fashion that is prioritizing by
    the relative。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: liquidity of each of the assets。 Now which measure is the right measure is the
    wrong way to think about it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Each measure provides slightly different information。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's just we're going from a more aggressive current ratio to a more conservative
    cash ratio。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But regardless of which one we look at， it's fairly clear that Intel has a reasonable
    stock。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of liquid assets that it can use to pay its current liabilities， its upcoming
    or short-term。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: obligations。 Now shifting gears from liquidity， we're going to go to coverage
    ratios starting with the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: interest coverage ratio。 And this is a very common ratio that appears in most
    financial credit agreements。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: most， bank loans。 As a covenant， firms are required to maintain a certain coverage
    ratio over the life of。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the loan lest they be in violation of that particular covenant。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The interest coverage ratio is just the ratio of EBIT or operating income to
    interest expense。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And we can see that for Intel， it's got $343。42 of operating income for each
    dollar of interest。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: expense。 Think about what that means。 It means they can easily handle all of
    their interest expense for the year just out of their。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: operating income， never mind their current assets。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But we don't just have to pay interest on our borrowings， we also have to pay
    principal。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so the debt service ratio accounts for that by including not just interest
    expense。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but also debt due within the year in the denominator。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so we see a large decline in the coverage ratio moving from interest to
    debt service。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: as you might expect， but still， Intel has almost $9 of operating income for
    every dollar。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of interest and principal that's owed over the next year。 In other words。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they have a great deal of coverage from their operations to take care。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of their financial obligations。 And then there's also something called a cash
    coverage ratio that looks at the ratio。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of cash assets from the balance sheet to interest expense。 And as we saw earlier。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they've got over $14 billion of cash assets more than enough to， take care of
    any interest expense。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So again， not to get lost in the forest here。 Intel has a decent amount of liquidity
    relative to its current obligations。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's generating a lot of operating income relative to its financial obligations，
    its。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: current financial obligations。 Then the last set of ratios I want to focus on
    are leverage ratios。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: which are a slightly， different take。 leverage ratios are looking at how the
    company is financing its operations。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And one of the more popular ones is debt to EBITDA。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This much like interest coverage shows up in a lot of different bank loans as
    a popular。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: covenant that borrowers have to abide by。 They have to maintain a leverage ratio
    below a certain threshold。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: such as three or four， whatever it may be， lest they be in violation of that
    particular covenant。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You see for Intel， the debt to EBITDA ratio is 。59 times， right？ So the amount
    of debt。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: short term and long term debt， is 。59 times their operating income。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: as measured by EBITDA as opposed to EBITDA。 So think about that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Does that mean that they have an enormous amount of debt relative to the operations？
    Hardly， right？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They've got， they've got， they're generating enough operating income basically
    to pay off。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: their entire debt bill almost twice over。 The remaining leverage ratios， debt
    to equity。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: cap debt to capital debt to assets， assets， to equity are again different versions
    of how the firm is funding itself from the perspective。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of just the balance sheet as opposed to both balance sheet and P&L。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so we can see that for example， the debt to asset ratio is 。15， meaning
    for every dollar。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of assets， 15 cents of those assets is being funded by debt， the other 85 by
    equity。 Again。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: not a highly levered or a low levered company as suggested by these different
    ratios。

    to Intel。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/8220f29f67036c49e3dc203b17865495_23.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG

    similar。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: if not stronger depending on which ratio you look at， liquidity， ratios relative
    to Intel。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's got a higher current ratio， a higher quick ratio and a slightly lower cash
    ratio， but。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: just looking at the liquidity ratios， it doesn't look as if AMD is in any imminent
    danger in。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the sense that it has significant current assets or liquid assets to take care
    of its。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/8220f29f67036c49e3dc203b17865495_25.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: However， when we start looking at their coverage ratios， we see the picture
    changing quite a， bit。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So let's take a look at the interest coverage ratio， remember which is their
    operating income。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: divided by their interest expense。 And we can see that that's actually less
    than one， it's 。86。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So for each dollar that they owe in interest in the upcoming year， they're only
    generating。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 86 cents of operating income， which means if they're going to make the interest
    payment。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they're going to have to find money elsewhere， probably on their balance sheet
    somewhere in。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: their current assets。 If we look at debt service， that is throw in the debt
    coming due over the next year。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we， see that that figure drops quite dramatically at more than halves so that
    for each dollar。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: owed in either interest or principal over the next year， they've only got 42
    cents of。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: operating income。 Again， that's telling us they've got to find money elsewhere
    because the operations aren't。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: generating enough to cover the debt burden。

    that they。

- en: And that's why the cash balance to interest expense ratio is so high， they're
    sitting on。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a relatively large amount of cash。 It also presents an interesting contrast
    with Intel。 See。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Intel can go about its operations and just from its operations， take care of
    all。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of its debt servicing needs。 Which means it can use its liquidity for strategic
    and operating reasons as opposed。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    care of its debt。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: service or at a minimum at least give its creditors some confidence that it
    will be able。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to pay its upcoming debts。 Now this difference shows up again in AMD's and Intel's
    leverage ratios。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: whereas Intel。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/8220f29f67036c49e3dc203b17865495_35.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: had 59 cents of total debt per dollar of operating income as measured by EBITDA。
    AMD is $6。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So it's six times， its leverage ratio is six times EBITDA。 Similarly。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: whereas Intel was funding its assets with 15 cents of debt and 85 cents of equity。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: AMD is funding its assets with almost 60 cents of debt and 40 cents of equity。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So a lot more debt usage and a relative sense for AMD。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now pause and think about what all this means。 What is this telling you about
    the relative credit risk of these two companies？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Really they're different。 And if you haven't already figured it out。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: though I imagine most everyone has， it should， be clear that AMD is in a much
    more financially precarious position than Intel。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Intel is in a much better position to take care of its financial obligations
    than AMD。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so we would say that AMD is a much riskier firm from a credit risk perspective
    than Intel。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So bringing this all together， what have we learned？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We've actually learned sort of the fundamentals of credit risk analysis。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now there's a lot more to it， but we've actually gotten quite far in terms of
    laying out some。
