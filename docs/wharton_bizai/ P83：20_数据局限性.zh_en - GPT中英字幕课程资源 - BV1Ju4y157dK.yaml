    learning。

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: there are a number of important limitations on the extent to which we can， use
    these models。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What I want to focus on right now are some of the technical limitations。 Okay。
    Specifically。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: what I want to talk about is how much accuracy we can really expect from these。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: models and where we see problems， particularly the role of inaccurate data，
    particularly the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: role of unmeasured factors。 And based on this， how we should think about what
    these algorithms can do for us and also。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: Let's start by talking a little bit about how much accuracy can we really expect。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So when you hear some people talk about machine learning， they convey the impression
    that if。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we use these models right， we'll be able to get almost perfect predictions about
    how people。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: will behave。 It's just a question of having the right algorithm。 That's not
    really true。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I think a lot of these impressions come from two places。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I think one is ultimately fairly misleading ways of representing the data。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I think also kind of analogies to success of AI in other tasks。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    be for managing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: people and particularly for predicting human behavior。 Let me talk a little
    bit about each of these。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It turns out when we describe the accuracy of our algorithms， there are multiple
    ways。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that we can do it。 And some of these roles， some of these ways of describing
    the algorithms are best flattering。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: or worse， deeply misleading。 My favorite example of this is you'll often hear
    people tell you that there are attrition。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: models， their predictions of who's going to leave and who's not going to leave
    have 90。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: or 95% accuracy。 And you listen to that and you think， that's amazing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They really know what people can do。 This is some real minority report kind
    of stuff。 It may not be。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So what I want to do right now， I want to demonstrate my incredible power。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So I'm going to actually propose to you a model that we'll predict who's going
    to leave。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: your organization within the next month。 It's going to do it with at least 95%
    accuracy。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: at least for most organizations。 In fact， we're going to do it now that there's
    going to be no extra charge for this service。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So here's the model that you can use to predict who's going to leave within
    the next month。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: at least 95% accuracy。 So what I want you to do is I want you to create an Excel
    spreadsheet and I want you。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to write in each row the name of each of your employees。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I want a second column and I want in that column， in each cell in that column，
    it's going to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: be an estimate of whether or not this person is going to leave next month。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And what I want you to do is put a zero in each cell in that column。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So we're going to predict that none of these employees is going to leave in
    the next month。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/944759fc783b8e9ed7dac7e8cf087812_7.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: Now， as long as fewer than 5% of your employees leave next month， pretty accurate
    for most。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: organizations， as long as fewer than 5% leave。 Next month。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: then this model is going to be 95% accurate， at least， right？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Because from almost all of your employees， we've predicted they wouldn't leave
    and they。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: didn't leave。 Okay， so great。 We've got a model that's 95% accurate。 Is it useful？
    No， no， it's not。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What you didn't want to do was just apply the average attrition rate to everybody
    in your。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: organization and realize by doing that， most of them aren't going to leave next
    month。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That's not helpful， right？ What we really want is a model that's going to explain
    the differences between the people。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: who leave and who don't leave。 Now， can we get a model that's going to explain
    95% of those differences。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: right？ Where the probability for those people who leave in the next month is
    going to be close。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to one and the probability of those people who stay in the next month is going
    to be close， to zero。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Can we get those differences close to 95%？ No。 Frankly。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I would say if we could explain 30% of those differences between the people
    who。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: left and the people who stayed， we'd be doing pretty well。 It's similar with
    hiring， right？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When we think about hiring， it's really our predictions about how people will
    perform in。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the future， right？ How much of the variation in people's performance can we
    explain through our hiring test？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And most of the evidence suggests 30% to 50% of the differences across candidates。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And I don't think there's much evidence that fancier and fancier algorithms
    are going to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: get us that much better。 Okay。 And so I think we need to understand that our
    ability to get strong results on all of these。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: algorithms is somewhat limited。 We can do a better job of explaining who's going
    to leave。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We can do a better job of explaining who's going to perform well than we can
    simply with， chance。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: can we get to 95%？ No way。 So why aren't these systems more accurate？
