- en: it is important to have the data infrastructure in place。 In this lecture。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I'm going to talk about data management tools that are necessary for companies
    to have in place before they can embark on large-scale AI initiatives。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: First， we'll talk a little bit about data warehousing。 To begin。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: many of you are likely familiar with the concept of a database。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A database is quite simply a structured collection of data。 Quite simply。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: an Excel spreadsheet can be thought of as a type of database。 Now， in practice。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we need usually better tools to manage data。 So database management systems
    or DBMSs are systems that allow users to better access and manage the database。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So Excel， again， provides some simple functionality。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but more advanced databases from Microsoft and Oracle and many other companies
    really help companies better manage their data。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And sometimes we refer to database management systems quite simply as a database。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A data warehouse is a particular kind of database management systems。 It's specialized
    in two ways。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: First， it's specialized in terms of the type of data a data warehouse stores。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Usually that is historic data from many sources in the enterprise。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A data warehouse is also specialized in terms of the purpose it serves， and
    that is analytics。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A usual database might serve operations。 For example。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: when a customer of a bank logs into the website and wants to look up their current
    account information。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: then you actually interact or that customer is interacting with an operational
    database。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that is able to pull data very fast and respond to customer queries like their
    current balance。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In contrast， analytics needs access to all of the data that a company might
    have or most of it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And the purpose there is usually not speed， but it's the ability to have a more
    comprehensive。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and more of a bird's eye view of all the data in the company。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And a data warehouse serves that purpose。 It's not necessarily the fastest database。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but it's specialized for the function of analytics。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and thus provides a more complete picture of the data in an organization。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Examples of data warehouses include Microsoft's Azure SQL data warehouse， Google
    BigQuery。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: Now， let's talk a little bit about how data warehouses work。 Usually in most
    companies。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: operational data is sitting in many different places。 For example。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: customer data might be sitting in a CRM system。 Some other enterprise information。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: including information about partners and supply chain， may be sitting in an
    ERP system。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Customer billing information might be sitting in another separate database。
    Now。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: if we want a unified view of all the data in the company。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we first need to pull all of that data into a data warehouse。 ETL tools are
    useful for that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: ETL stands for extract， transform， and load。 These tools pull the data out of
    the different individual databases。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example， they'll pull the customer data out of the CRM system。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the customer's billing data out of the billing system， and so on。 All of that
    data is pulled out。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it's transformed as needed， and then loaded into the data warehouse。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Popular ETL tools include tools built by companies like Informatica and Stitch。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: which is now part of a company called Talon and many others。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The data warehouse now has all of the data from all these different sources。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Once we have this data in one place， you can now build reporting and data visualization
    tools。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: on top of that。 For example， business intelligence tools like Tableau sit on
    top of the data warehouse。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and when an analyst enters a query， these systems can then go into the data
    warehouse。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and pull the necessary information。 Next， let's talk about the value of a data
    warehouse。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The main purpose or value of a data warehouse is that it serves as a single
    point of access。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: for all data in the company。 And it's where a history of all the data is stored。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And as I mentioned earlier， a data warehouse helps separate operations from
    analytics。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Usually the operations data is meant to be fast so that when a customer logs
    in。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you can pull the data fast and respond to information such as the customer's
    balance。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: On the other hand， certain analytics queries might require a more comprehensive
    access to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: historical data and an assurance of data quality。 For example， if an analyst
    wants to know。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: how much revenue has each product line brought in， over the last 10 years？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And we want that data broken out by month and by city and state。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That kind of a query requires access to a lot of historical data over the last
    10 years。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and the data warehouse provides that assurance of data quality and that single
    point of access。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to all of that data。 Now， so that's a little bit about data warehouses。
  prefs: []

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: As part of data infrastructure， we should also talk about big data tools such
    as， Hadoop and Spark。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now， big data tools like Hadoop serve two main purposes， storage and processing。
    Now。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: storage of big data usually has some unique challenges。 If we want to store
    a little bit of data。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a few files， we can typically store that in our computers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But what if there's massive amounts of data？ Data for millions or hundreds of
    millions of customers over the last 10。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 20 years。 That kind of data cannot be stored in a single computer。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so one of the things that a big data tool like Hadoop does is that it stores
    it in a。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: distributed fashion across multiple computers or multiple nodes。 Next， these
    systems also take。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: care of processing that data。 And usually that processing again involves distributed
    processing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of that data across multiple nodes or across multiple machines and also parallelizing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the computations or data processing as much as possible， which helps increase
    speed。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Hadoop is an open source tool that is offered by the Apache Foundation， which
    is a non-profit。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: foundation that provides open source software。 The most popular distribution
    of Hadoop is by a。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: company called Cloudera， although there are several others。 And Spark is a more
    recent version。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: or in fact， I would say a more dominant replacement for Hadoop， which serves
    similar purposes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but solves some of the problems that Hadoop had faced in the past。 Data bricks
    is the most。
