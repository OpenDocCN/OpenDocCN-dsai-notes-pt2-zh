 So last video， we talked about firm practices such as organization structures and how skills。



![](img/2e51f0bfd5f948ac1118c54dbfd1339d_1.png)

 should be distributed。 In this video， I'm going to talk about other managerial practices and employee management。

 practices associated with AI。 And this is really fundamentally motivated by the fact that growth in AI and related。

 investment has been extremely rapid in the last couple of years。

 And how does that change the employee compositions？ Specifically。

 how should managers react to this growing investment in AI？

 And what kinds of firm practices are needed to accommodate this change？ Not just for innovation。

 but generally this rapid automation on various types of work。



![](img/2e51f0bfd5f948ac1118c54dbfd1339d_3.png)

 And you probably heard a lot of these type of articles in popular press about how robots。

 and AI are potentially causing a huge turbulence in both employment and managerial practices。

 You probably heard a lot of articles about jobs for robots， the fact that robots can， be now。

 then AI robots will destroy all our jobs and we're still not ready for it。

 And this is published in Foreign Affairs， Harvard Business Reviews， and even policymakers。

 in European Union has proposed some kind of robot tax。 In the 2020 presidential campaign。

 de Blasio famously proposed a robot tax to Buddhist campaign， before it flamed out。

 And Bill Gates also proposed that maybe robots should be taxed as human。

 These are sounds interesting， but fundamentally we actually do not know to what extent is AI。

 and robots really affect employment and to what extent do managerial practices need。

 to accommodate these changes。 So before we start with any kind of policy implications。

 we should actually have hard， facts on how does AI and robots change the nature of jobs。

 And we actually did a nation study in the entire country of Canada。

 We actually captured all the robot adoption in specific firms in a very fine detail level。

 And this again， this study is using tax taxation data and also census data。

 That means almost all firms need to reply for compliance。 So we got like 80。

 90% all firms in Canada responding to the survey。 You can see that robot adoption is rapidly growing in services compared to manufacturing。

 So this is a little bit different than what we thought before that robots is really affecting。

 manufacturing。 But here we actually see robot adoption speed growth is actually in services。

 especially， in recent years。 Of course you see the one of the biggest adopters for robots are manufacturing。

 And you see that in other industry， heavy machinery industries。

 And you also see the growth being quite rapid in healthcare， in scientific research， and。

 also in other services。 So again， this is not just a manufacturing story。

 but it's really a global economy story， including both manufacturing and services。



![](img/2e51f0bfd5f948ac1118c54dbfd1339d_5.png)

 So we've seen that robot or AI adoptions have increased dramatically over time。

 And AI may mirror that adoption pattern and growth may even be faster as a new generation。

 of AI becoming more used in mainstream。 And in our study。

 we actually seen that our productivity associated with robot adoption， is quite high。

 It's actually 10 times factor share。 So what does it mean is that if you adopt robots and a perfectly equilibrium。

 you should， get exactly the value of your robots。 So it's similar to how much investment。

 But here I'm telling you is that the productivity associated with robot options is 10 times value。

 time time factor share。 So it means there's a huge productivity improvement associated with robots。

 And a dispersion of that is quite high。 Some firms do really well with robots， some firms don't。

 That suggests complementary organization changes are happening associated with robot adoption。



![](img/2e51f0bfd5f948ac1118c54dbfd1339d_7.png)

 To give you an idea of what exactly is going on with robot and employment。

 We break it down into both employment and also with managers。

 So contrary to the popular narrative that robots killing all jobs， you see on the left， hand side。

 it's the event study basically you can read the zero being the year your。

 dot robot and native number are the years before your dot robot。

 So negative two means two years before your dot robot being a firm or being a firm adopting。

 robot and a positive value two means the two years after your dot robot。

 And the y-axis is what is the effect of robot on a changed employment。

 You can see that before firm adopted robots， this virtually is just hovering around zero。

 Robots shouldn't have an effect on employment when they don't invest in any。

 And on zero you see an increase in employment。 And gradually increase after two or three years。

 Even in plateaued after five， six years， it's still higher than the initial level。

 So it's actually opposite of popular narrative that robots actually increased employment overall。

 But this effect is not uniform。 If you look at the right hand graph。

 you almost see the exact opposite pattern。 But this graph is instead of measuring total employment。

 you're measuring how many managers， are there before and after you dot robots。

 So before you dot robots， again it's hovering around zero。 And the year you adopted robots。

 managerial employment has gone down quite a bit。 In plateaued a little bit for a year or two and another big decrease after a year three。



![](img/2e51f0bfd5f948ac1118c54dbfd1339d_9.png)

 or four。 It's different from what we think。 So why will robots increase employment but decrease managers？

 It seems almost counterintuitive because managers by definition manage other people。

 How could we replace them with robots？ Are robots really our managers？ What's going on here？

 And this is not a statistical fluke。 If you look at managerial employees between the two types of firms。

 the robot adopting firms， the blue lines， the solid blue lines， and the non-robot adopting firm。

 the dash-red lines。 And we plot a share of managerial employees over time。

 You can see the robot adopting firms are gradually reducing the share of managers and employees。

 Whereas the non-adopting firms for robots have pretty much constant share managers。

 So it's really something about robot adopting firms that are changing。

 Not the non-robot adopting firms。 So why managers？ Well。

 maybe because managers are really expensive。 So maybe if you want a cost cut。

 you want to get rid of them first。 Interestingly， we can actually measure that。

 In part of our survey， we actually asked this question， which of the following factors was。

 respect to the relative importance to your workplace general business strategies？

 And one of the questions I want to ask is reducing labor costs and really important strategic。

 priorities or is improving product services and a few others too。



![](img/2e51f0bfd5f948ac1118c54dbfd1339d_11.png)

 And notice， when we linked reducing labor costs as a strategic priority to robot adoption。

 the fact size is zero， and almost no relationship between the two。

 But if you were firm strategic priorities was to improve product services， that's highly。

 correlated with the propensity to adopt robots。 So it's really not about cost cutting here。

 but it's really about how do firms improve， product services that ultimately drives the firms with adopt robots。

 So it's not about managers being really expensive。

 So why does AI and robots have profound effect of managerial employees and also managerial。

 practices？ The true reason for that。

![](img/2e51f0bfd5f948ac1118c54dbfd1339d_13.png)

 Number one， remember the graph I showed you earlier where it decreased dramatically first。

 and then it plateaued and decreased again two years later。

 If you think about automation technology as enabled by robot and AI， a lot of reporting。

 tools like who showed up on time， whether they done the thing they should be doing， clock。

 can clock out， and these types of work can be relatively managed by technologies already。

 So it kind of leaves a lot of managers with other types of work。

 It was a supervising role that has decreased quite a bit。

 So there's probably a immediate effect on technology effect。 Basically technology。

 we play some of the managerial functions。 But still they're managing people。

 Technology can capture some of the monitoring technologies， can capture some of the aspect。

 of them supervising roles， but cannot be capturing all or even not most of it。

 Remember two years later there's another dip。 And that is likely to come from the fact that employment composition has fundamentally。

 changed after a robot。 It's being adopted。 So what do I mean by that？



![](img/2e51f0bfd5f948ac1118c54dbfd1339d_15.png)

 So I actually disaggregated the total employment by the skill type they have。

 Are they highly educated？ Are they middle skilled or are they low skilled？

 High skilled being you have university degree for your graduate degree。

 And middle skilled being you have some， you graduate from high school and you have some。

 kind of accreditation。 Two years， so two degrees， some kind of trade skill accreditation。

 And low skilled being people who have just high school degree or less。 Okay。

 So if you look at the robots effect on the high middle low skill workers， look at how。

 different they look。 The first bar is just total employment。 I showed you that already。

 So each bar here is we're measuring the effect of robots on the total employment on high school。

 employees and middle skilled employees and low skilled employees。 So each bar is the effect。

 So notice that high skill has gone up。 The demand for high skilled workers has gone up quite a bit after a robot。

 Compared to low skilled workers， it's much smaller。 Low skill has increased quite a bit too。

 So both high skill increase was low being much more than high skills。

 But notice the middle skilled workers on that bar is a big negative number。

 So although robot has increased unemployment for all workers。

 the effect is varying his heterogeneous。 You see a huge effect。

 positive effect on low skilled workers。 Some effects positive effect on high skilled workers。

 but very negative effect on the middle， skilled workers。

 That's problematic because that changes the type of people that managers are needing to。



![](img/2e51f0bfd5f948ac1118c54dbfd1339d_17.png)

 manage now， do supervise now。 When you have such a large change in employment composition。

 the type of managers you need， will also need to evolve。

 So what does it mean to manage a very high and very low skilled workers are going to。

 be very different from managing middle skilled workers。

 Low skilled workers are working very much standardized。

 You can think of picking and packing on Amazon warehouse。 You have camera， you can， you know。

 looking out there， showing up on time or not。 You can have each scan code on the product。

 You know exactly how many boxes were product and process。

 So all of that can be traced and monitored。 So you probably don't need many supervisors to teach low skilled workers how to do their。

 jobs。 Little training needed and much of it is standardized and can be easily monitored using technologies。

 So compared middle skilled work， you probably need less supervisors。

 But managing high skilled workers is also very different because these people are probably。

 expert themselves。 They probably know how to do their jobs better than their supervisors and their managers。

 So their managers are probably more acting like a advisor， a coach and helping them to。

 do their job as supposed to telling them exactly how to do it。 So again。

 the type of manager or managerial skills needed to manage high skilled workers。

 can be quite different from middle skilled skilled workers。 So again。

 because of this employment composition change， you see a lot higher low skilled workers。

 and a lot lower middle skilled workers are moderately high skilled workers。

 You really need a different type of management。

![](img/2e51f0bfd5f948ac1118c54dbfd1339d_19.png)

 So as a result， you see that manager on average has gone down。

 And that is because most of the most of the employment increases coming from low skilled， workers。



![](img/2e51f0bfd5f948ac1118c54dbfd1339d_21.png)

 If most employment has gone to a high skilled worker， you may have a different result。

 You may not have seen a drastic decrease in managers。 That's before。 But either way。

 the type of people we manage can be different。 Therefore。

 the type of managers you need are different。 Number is gone down。 But more importantly。

 firm practices are changing to accommodate or to co-evolve with robot adoption。 So specifically。

 we looked at three different firm practices。 First we look at span of control。

 How many people are being managed by a single manager on average？

 So if our results are correct in the sense that there are many more employees， a lot。

 fewer managers， on average span of control should also be going up。

 A lot more people under single manager。 We independently measure that we ask the ash manager how many people are managing。

 We have independently confirmed that span of control has indeed gone up。

 So managers have to manage a lot more people than they had before。

 We also look at work predictability。 To what extent can you actually predict your hours when you need to do？

 And if you think about that robots are doing all the predictable part because you remember。

 AI machine learning a great prediction machine， mining patterns that we haven't seen before。

 And using that pattern to predict what's going to happen next。

 If all the predictable elements are going to be done by robots， maybe leaving workers。

 with all the unpredictable parts。 And you have indeed seen that work and predictability has gone up quite a bit after robot。

 So this also suggests that nature work is changing。 And lastly。

 if you think about robots can decrease the variance in production， remember。

 robots using algorithm can do the same thing over and over again without being tired， without。

 taking a bathroom break， without taking a lunch break。

 They can do a 24/7 in a dark room without ECU。 And that reduction variance could also mean that the fact that what you produced can be。

 more attributed to your effort， your abilities as opposed to some random noise。

 So now the firm may be able to more accurately capture what exactly is your contribution。

 to production process。 By more easily attributing to your performance to the actual effort what you actually did。

 individual pay performance could also go up。 And we have indeed shown that performance pay have gone up after robot has been adopted。

 But again， these are evolving。 We're just scratching the surface here。

 But overall we do see that robot is dramatically changing firm practices， especially in how。



![](img/2e51f0bfd5f948ac1118c54dbfd1339d_23.png)

 people are being managed。 And lastly， I want you to show that this dramatic change is not just about people。

 but also， decision rights allocations。 Who are making decisions for these tasks in the firms？

 And you see that this is robot adoption is also changing who deciding what。

 So in the first one we asked who deciding who gets trained for what？

 Before an effort robot adoption， this is what we see。 We see that middle bars management。

 Managers are making a lot of less decisions on what you should be trained for and what。

 you should be trained for。 Where employees are doing most of that decision for themselves。

 In the left most bar， nine managers。 So decision rights are shifting from managers to non-managers on the decision on what type。

 of thing they need to learn， what kind of thing they need to train for。

 For CEO upper level management， that fact is pretty much zero。

 So it's really about decentralizing that decision rights for managers to non-managers。

 We also see decision rights for the choice of production technology。

 Who is making the decision on what production technology to use？

 Here again we see managers losing that decision rights。

 We see that managers no longer making that decision as much as that decision is moving。

 toward the CEO， the C-suite and the C-suite managers。 We see that for non-managers。

 there's really no effect there。 For managers， middle level managers， a big decrease for owners。

 CEO level， that decision， rights has gone up。 You can see not only the managers are decreasing in their pure number of headcounts。

 but what， they do have fundamentally changed and the decision rights are also being centralized。

 decentralized the way。

![](img/2e51f0bfd5f948ac1118c54dbfd1339d_25.png)

 This is a very subtle story than before because when we think about it， robot AI are not supposed。

 to change managers because they manage other people， people manage other people。 We haven't。

 the fact that robots can perform managerial tasks is something kind of far-fetched。

 But here when I'm showing it's not as hard because robots can do so much when managers， can do。

 but fundamentally because the type of managers， the type of employees have changed。

 the ultimately meaning that the type of managers need are different。 When you adopt robots and AI。

 it's not just about plug-in existing， take out existing， system plug AI in， it's not just that。

 You actually have to examine the entire process because there's going to be ripple effects on。

 everything you do， on decision rights， employment hiring， turnover type of managers you need。

 various firm practices and compensation， et cetera。

 So say important and profound decision and to do that you need to figure out what impacts。

 are these technology are really changing and how are you supposed to accommodate that change。

 So I'm giving you some idea where it could be。 But it's really important for managers themselves to examine specifically in their context how。

 these processes are changing。 And you may see some resistance in managers if they believe that these kind of technology。

 could replace managers。 And that could create a situation where firms should adopt robots and don't。

 And that's actually precisely what had sort of happened in some of the two exams in our， data。

 We actually see that the robot adopting firms are far more productive， higher or a lot more。

 people than non-robot adopting firms。 And whatever lose。

 whatever loss you have seen in the popular press or an earlier study on。

 country industry level studies that's shown with a employment loss， it actually come from。

 the non-robot adopting firms losing market shares， losing competitiveness because they。

 didn't adopt robots for whatever reason， for whatever reason。

 Could be resistance from worker managers， could be many other reasons。 But again。

 robot adoption AI is not a small decision。

![](img/2e51f0bfd5f948ac1118c54dbfd1339d_27.png)

 It has ripple effects toward organization。 With conclusion that nature of the manager work is changing and practice is evolving。

 So we've shown that robot adopting firms increase productively and hire more people。

 but only for the firm adopted。 The firm didn't adopt in the same ministry actually experienced a greater employment loss。

 And we see that this really shows managers in the sense that robots associated with less。

 managers hiring greater turnovers and it's not cost driven， it's quality driven。 As a result。

 the type of people after robot adoption are very different from the type。

 of people you manage beforehand。 That means you're going to see a lot of more decision changes associated management。

 And it's important to continue and monitor how this change evolve and customize it for。

 your particular firms。
