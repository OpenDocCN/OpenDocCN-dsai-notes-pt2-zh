- en: by discussing data mining。 Now data mining is a broad term that refers to tools
    for discovering。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: patterns in large datasets。 To understand what exactly is data mining， it is
    useful。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to contrast data mining from something many of you understand， which is simple
    statistical。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: regressions。 Now， when we are conducting regressions， we might start off with
    a hypothesis。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example， we are trying to understand what are the factors that predict whether
    a customer。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: might default and not pay their credit card dues。 So we might come up with a
    hypothesis。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that the risk of default depends on a number of factors such as whether they
    have defaulted。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in the past。 That is， we have a hypothesis that people who have defaulted previously
    are。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: likely to default again。 We might also have a hypothesis that people who have
    a large。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: number of credit cards are likely to default because they are perhaps struggling
    to manage。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: their finances。 Lastly， we might have a hypothesis that people who are employed
    might be less。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: likely to default。 Now， the goal of the regression might be to test these hypotheses。
    So we might。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: run a regression based on past data where we test what is the risk of a person
    defaulting。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and whether it depends on these factors， meaning prior default number of credit
    cards and whether。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they are employed or not。 The regression tells us whether these factors matter
    or not。 And。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it also tells us how much it matters。 So on the slide， you see that whether
    a person。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: defaulted in the past or not has an impact on whether they default again in
    the future。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and the regression coefficient 0。93 tells us how important it is。 Now， notice
    that all。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: these important variables like number of credit cards， whether they are employed
    or not。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: whether they have defaulted in the past or not。 These came from a hypothesis
    the analyst， had。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That is at the heart of traditional data analysis。 That is at the heart of regression。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: testing as well。 Data mining in contrast is more about data driven exploration。
    So it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: may not start with a hypothesis as I previously mentioned。 There are a number
    of different。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: techniques that are part of data mining。 And in fact， data mining is a catch
    all term。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: for a number of these techniques。 I will not go over all of the techniques that
    are part。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of data mining because really there are a very large set of such techniques。
    But I will。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: go over a couple useful examples。 The first one is clustering。 Clustering is
    a data mining。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/453485bcfeda29a06b0e97df8113ad0e_3.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: technique that is used to group our data。 And so essentially clustering will
    break up。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: our data into a bunch of smaller groups or clusters such that data points within
    a cluster。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: are similar to each other and data points in different clusters are different
    from each， other。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A classic application of clustering might be in determining customer segments，
    in our data。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The old way of doing customer segmentation might be from your gut。 A marketing
    manager。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: might say based on their experience that we have three kinds of customer segments。
    And。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they might describe these customer segments in terms of some customer demographics。
    Like。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they might say one of those customer segments might be soccer moms in families
    of four or。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: five people who live in suburban places。 And that might be how they might articulate
    what。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: one of the customer segments is like。 In contrast， when you use clustering，
    we're trying to figure。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: out the customers and the customer segments from a data driven manner without
    these hypotheses。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And clustering might either validate the gut of the manager and might indicate
    and show。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that the purchasing patterns of suburban soccer moms are different from the
    purchase patterns。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of other customers。 Or it might suggest that the differences are not that important
    and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: maybe there's a different way we should be thinking about customer segments。
    Another。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: data mining tool is association rule mining。 Association rule mining is a data
    mining technique。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/453485bcfeda29a06b0e97df8113ad0e_5.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: that finds common co occurrences in the data。 For example， we might analyze
    shopping cart。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: data or purchase patterns of customers at a grocery store。 And we might look
    at common。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: patterns in there。 And association rule mining software might find a pattern
    such as people。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: who tend to buy bread and butter in a transaction also tend to buy milk in that
    same transaction。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If we find this transaction， we might take action based on it。 For example，
    a traditional。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: grocery store， meaning a brick and mortar grocery store might decide to stock
    bread， butter and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: milk close by。 Or an online grocery store might decide that if a customer has
    already added。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: bread and butter to their shopping cart， then it's going to make a recommendation
    to the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: customer to also add milk。 There are many applications of association rule mining
    techniques。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in business data in order to find patterns in those data。 Another example might
    be applications。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in healthcare。 One example that comes to my mind is an analysis of Reynolds
    disease that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: was done by a computer scientist or information scientist by the name of Don
    Swanson。 Don Swanson。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: was interested in studying Reynolds disease， which is a syndrome that affects
    the musculoskeletal。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: system。 He was in particular interested in identifying novel treatments for
    Reynolds disease。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: because at that time there were not very many known treatments for Reynolds
    disease or Reynolds。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: syndrome。 In order to answer that， Don Swanson looked at a number of research
    papers on Reynolds。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: disease and found what kinds of concepts are associated with Reynolds disease。
    In other， words。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: what are the common co-occurrences with the term Reynolds disease？ He found
    that blood。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: viscosity is a term that often co-occurs with a discussion of Reynolds disease。
    He also。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: found that musculoskeletal issues are often discussed in articles that talk
    about Reynolds， disease。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example， he found that articles that talk about Reynolds phenomenon or Reynolds。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: syndrome talk about an increase of blood viscosity during Reynolds syndrome。
    Next， he asked what。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: kinds of other concepts are commonly co-occurring with ideas such as blood viscosity
    and musculoskeletal。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: weakness。 He found one concept which is EPA or icosopentanoic acid， which was
    commonly discussed。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: along with blood viscosity， along with musculoskeletal weakness and along with
    a number of ideas that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: are associated with Reynolds disease。 For example。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: he found phrases such as EPA or icosopentanoic acid， helps reduce blood viscosity。
    In contrast。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Reynolds disease increases blood viscosity。 EPA is also associated with strengthening
    the musculoskeletal system and in contrast。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Reynolds disease is associated with weakening of the musculoskeletal system。
    Based on this。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Don Swanson came up with the hypotheses that EPA， which is found commonly in，
    fish oil。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: can help treat Reynolds disease。 And indeed， later clinical trials showed that
    fish oil。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: is an effective treatment for Reynolds disease。 Now， I should clarify here that
    Don Swanson did。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: not use association rule mining software。 Instead， he used the same idea and
    did it manually。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But in his later research， he talked about how his scientific process could
    perhaps be automated。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: using tools that are finding common co-occurrences in data。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is what is at the heart of association， rule mining software。 Now。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: data mining techniques such as clustering and association rule mining。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: ultimately are about finding patterns in data。 The next step beyond just finding
    patterns。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: is to perhaps make predictions about the future and take action from it。 For
    example。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: can we predict， demand for our product in the future and figure out production
    decisions based on that？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Can we predict whether a transaction that just happened is fraudulent or not？
    That is where。

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: the domain of predictive analytics comes in。 And let's look at a couple examples
    of what。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we can do with predictive analytics。 Let's look at a large retail company such
    as Amazon。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A customer might visit the website。 They might actually look and or browse at
    a few products。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They might eventually pay for these products and the items are shipped by Amazon。
    Now。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the goal of the retailer is to convince the customer to buy the product。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Often retailers like Amazon will show recommendations to the consumer。 For example。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: recommendations such as people who bought this also bought this or people who
    viewed this product。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: also viewed that product。 At the heart of these recommendations is an attempt
    to try and figure。
  prefs: []

  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: out what kinds of products might this customer be interested in。 That ultimately
    is hoping to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: convince the customer to buy a product。 That's an example of a predictive analytics
    application。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that is trying to predict what kinds of product a customer might be interested
    in。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another example might be that when a customer is ready to buy the product， they
    might enter their。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: credit card information and hit purchase now or buy now。 At this point， algorithms
    at the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: retailer's website have to figure out whether this is a legitimate transaction
    or not。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In particular， whether the credit card is a legitimate credit card that is owned
    by this customer who is placing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the order or is it likely that this is stolen。 Here， predictive analytics techniques
    look at past。
