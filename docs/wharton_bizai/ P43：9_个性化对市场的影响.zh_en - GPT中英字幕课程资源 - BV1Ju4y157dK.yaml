    a product。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    bought B and we end up buying B。

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: But either way， nearly a third of the choices on Amazon's retail website are
    attributed。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to algorithmic recommendations。 Similarly， a study on recommendations at news
    websites in particular at Google News。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: suggested that algorithmic recommendations increased consumer usage of the website
    by about 38 percent。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So people consume more news， spent more time on Google News。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    video hours。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    in short。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we have seen that recommendations can drive consumer choice in many settings。
    Now。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: what is interesting is that they don't just increase the volume of consumption。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

- en: There are many theories about how they might influence the choices we make。
    Now。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: one theory which actually is dates back to the mid-2000s is called the Longtail
    Theory。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's based on a book called the Longtail by author Chris Anderson。 In the book。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the author suggested that the internet in general would help drive consumer。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: searches or preferences and purchases from the most popular items to more niche
    items。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So in other words， the internet would help drive a shift in demand from blockbuster
    items。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: towards more niche items。 And in terms of the mechanisms that help make this
    shift possible。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: one of the key mechanisms was automated recommendations。 Specifically。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: he suggested that the main effect of automated recommendations。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: would be to help move people from the world of hits to the world of niche items。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And the main reason this might happen is that in the absence of recommendations。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we might consult lists such as， let's say， blockbuster lists or bestseller lists。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and we might make our choices based on those lists。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But recommendations might help drive our attention to items that are closer
    to our preferences。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but aren't necessarily very popular。 But the question is， is that really true？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Especially given that collaborative filtering algorithms recommend items。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: based on what others are consuming， so don't they depend on some information
    on popularity in order to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: recommend items。 Now， let's look at whether that happens or not。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/612474cf267c057a15fd56c705faf98a_11.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: Now， one way we can measure whether purchases are diverse or not。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: is by looking at what is known as the "gini coefficient of consumption。"， Now。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the "gini coefficient" is a measure of diversity of consumption or of income
    concentration。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's used in a number of different settings。 The way you compute "gini coefficient"
    is to first draw what is known as the Lorentz curve。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Lorentz curve is the curve that you see on the figure that is in dark black。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and that's labeled "L" of you。 The Lorentz curve denotes the fraction of total
    sales generated by a certain percentage of products。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So in other words， what the Lorentz curve over here is indicating is that the
    bottom 20% of product。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: generate a negligible amount of sales， perhaps less than 1% of sales。 In this
    figure。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the bottom 40% of products are generating a little less than 10% of sales。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The bottom 60% of products are generating roughly about 20% of sales。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So that's essentially what the Lorentz curve is indicating。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The diagonal line that you see in the figure is essentially indicating what
    the Lorentz curve would。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: look like if all products had equal sales。 If all products had equal sales。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the bottom 20% of products， would generate 20% of sales。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the bottom 40% of products would generate 40% of sales， and so on。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now the Gini coefficient is a measure of the area between the Lorentz curve
    and that diagonal 45。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: degree line。 If the Gini coefficient is zero， then it implies all products have
    equal sales。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If the Gini coefficient is one， it implies one product generated all the sales。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So now we could ask whether recommender systems move the Gini coefficient in
    a market closer to zero。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: or closer to one， meaning closer to greater sales diversity or closer to lower
    sales diversity。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/612474cf267c057a15fd56c705faf98a_13.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: We actually can study this where we can create a world where there are no recommendations
    and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: let's call the Gini coefficient in that market as G0。 And suppose some recommender
    R is used in。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that market and the Gini coefficient obtained in that market with that recommender
    is GI。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: then we can ask whether the recommender system has a diversity bias or a concentration
    bias。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: by looking at whether GI is less than or greater than G0。 So that is the idea
    behind this。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/612474cf267c057a15fd56c705faf98a_15.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: So to test that， we actually partnered with one of the large retailers in North
    America。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We partnered， actually with a top five retailer in North America and we ran
    a field experiment with them in August。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of 2013 where we ran specifically an AB test where some users were assigned
    to a group that did not。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: receive any recommendations and some other users were assigned to a group that
    received recommendations。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/612474cf267c057a15fd56c705faf98a_17.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: Specifically， we took over 1。3 million users who visited the website and we
    partitioned them into。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: three groups。 The first group， which we'll call is the control group and about
    77% of our user base。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: was assigned to the control group， they received no recommendations。 The second
    group。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: which is about， 11。5% of the 1。3 million users， they received a view based collaborative
    filtering recommendation。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: meaning a recommendation that said people who viewed this item also viewed these
    other items。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And lastly， the third group received purchase based collaborative filtering
    recommendations。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: meaning a recommendation of the firm， people who bought this item also bought
    these other items。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Next， we looked at how the Gini coefficients differed for these three groups。
    So let's look at that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/612474cf267c057a15fd56c705faf98a_19.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: On the figure that you see on the slide， in black， we have the Lorentz curve
    for the control group。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that received no recommendations。 In dotted red， we have the Lorentz curve for
    the group that received。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: view based recommendations。 What you will notice is that the market share of
    the bottom 40% of products。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: dropped significantly after recommendations were turned on。 Similarly， the market
    share of the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: bottom 60% of products also dropped significantly after recommendations were
    turned on。 This can be。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: directly seen in the Gini coefficient measures。 So the Gini coefficient for
    the group that received。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: no recommendations is 0。6， whereas the Gini coefficient for the group that received
    recommendations of。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the firm， people who viewed this product also viewed those products， actually
    increased to 0。68。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In other words， sales became more concentrated。 Next， we can see what happens
    with the purchase。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: based collaborative filter。 In this graph， again， I have the Lorentz curve for
    the control group in。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: black and the Lorentz curve for the purchase based collaborative filter in dotted
    red。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We will see that the result is even more stark this time。 The market share of
    the bottom products。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: decreased quite dramatically and the Gini coefficient in the world with recommendations。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: increased quite significantly from 0。6 in the control group to 0。7 in the group
    that received。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: recommendations。 In other words， there is ample evidence that collaborative
    filters have a significant。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: popularity bias。 They tend to recommend products based on what others are viewing
    or what others。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: are purchasing。 And therefore， they tend to reinforce the popularity of already
    popular products。
  prefs: []

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: Now， there is one caveat to all of this。 In this graph here， I have plotted
    the absolute sales。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: not the market share of products， but the absolute sales of products before
    and after recommendations。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And what is worth noting is that the absolute sales of all products， whether
    we're talking。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    the sales of the。

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: In other words， what is happening is that recommendation systems help all products。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: whether niche or， popular products get discovered。 However。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they benefit popular products disproportionately。 This is somewhat analogous
    to the debate on income inequality。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: People talk about income。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/612474cf267c057a15fd56c705faf98a_25.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: inequality， but if you look at data over the last 25， 30 years， especially say
    here in the US。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: there is ample evidence that on an absolute scale， the income of all groups，
    whether we're。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: talking about the rich or the middle class or the poor， all of their income
    has gone up。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But on a relative basis， the rich have benefited much more than the poor and
    that's why there's。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a debate about income inequality。 So we observe a very similar result where
    all kinds of products。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: whether popular or unpopular benefit and get discovered more under recommendations。
    However。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the more popular products tend to get discovered and tend to benefit much more
    than the niche products。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: under collaborative filters。 And that is one of the main findings that we have
    from not just this study。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    tend to have a popularity。

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    help people find。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: products that are close to their preference。 However。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: those products need not be the most popular items。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
