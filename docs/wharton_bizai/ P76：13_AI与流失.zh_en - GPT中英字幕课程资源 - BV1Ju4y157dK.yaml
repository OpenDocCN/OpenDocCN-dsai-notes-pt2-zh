- en: I mentioned already in one of the earlier videos， organizations pay an immense
    amount。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of attention to attrition， trying to figure out why people are leaving and what
    they can。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: do about it， because attrition is so costly to them。 Probably because of this。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: attrition is along with hiring the area where I think there。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: have been the most advances and where organizations are already using machine
    learning tools the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: most to change how they manage people。 If you think about what these machine
    learning tools do。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: again， it's not terribly complex， right？ If we were asking one of our friends
    to figure out who's going to leave。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they would do， something that's much like a machine learning model， right？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We're trying to figure out who's going to leave and say， "Okay， what information
    would， we look at？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '"， There''s a bunch of things that are obvious。 So， we''d think about for each
    person。'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: what are their personal circumstances and where， are they in their career？ So，
    for example。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we know young people tend to change jobs a lot more partly。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They're still trying to figure out where they fit。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They may also be more likely to leave to go back to school， so if they're young，
    maybe。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they're bigger flight risk。 We'd also look at their resumes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There's somebody who changes firms a lot。 If they've done so in the past。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: chance are they more likely to do so again？ So， yeah。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we might include some of those in our estimate。 We'd probably look at the job
    that they're in。 So。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: some roles tend to have higher attrition。 Could be because they're boring。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It could be because these are jobs where the skills are in high demand and it's
    easier。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to find those jobs elsewhere。 But between the two that would tell us something
    about their chances。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I talked already about engagement。 Certainly， we'd look at any signals that
    they're either engaged or disengaged。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We might look at whether things are going well for them at work and how withdrawn
    are they？ So。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: if we were going to sit down and look at any individual person， do I think they're。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: going to leave in the next year？ These are a bunch of the things that we might
    look at。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When we're using machine learning， that's pretty much what we're doing。 Only。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we're combining all these characteristics in a systematic way using past data
    and all。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of those features of people and then also past data on which people stayed and
    which。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: people left to understand how each of these characteristics might feed in to
    a prediction， model。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When we do that， we get two advantages relative to just having supervisors guess
    who's likely。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to leave。 The first is the model is going to be more accurate。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We do okay with some of these estimates。 We tend not to be very good at effectively
    waiting multiple different criteria。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: These machine learning models do it much better than we can。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The other advantage is you can get your manager to sit down and say who's likely
    to leave。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Maybe we'll do it every six months， but managers get distracted， they move on
    to other things。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the nice things about machine learning， it doesn't get distracted。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We can set up a model that is constantly trawling through the data and constantly
    flagging up。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: looks like this person might be at flight risk。 When we do it， when we have
    those probabilities。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: then we can do something about it as I'll go。
