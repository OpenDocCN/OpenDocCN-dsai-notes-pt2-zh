    HR process。

- en: or can be used in the HR process， it's useful to stop at rule-based systems
    or expert systems。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We talked about a couple of drawbacks to the approach where humans are making
    decisions。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's time consuming for one。 But one thing we can do is take what humans know
    about the process。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: all their expertise， about hiring and recruiting， and we can put that into software。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So rule-based systems， basically they encode in experts' knowledge and skills
    into a software-based model。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So what these systems do is they convert conditions of hiring in this case into
    a series of rules。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For those of you who might be familiar with programming， you can think about
    these as if-then rules。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's very similar to as if an expert， in this case the domain expert or the
    HR or the recruiter。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: were to write down all of the knowledge they had about how to hire， about what
    type of candidates。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a good fit for the organization。 And then a developer might convert those rules
    into software。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so from that point on then， the software which contained the knowledge that
    the recruiter had。
  prefs: []

- en: could then be used to evaluate applications。 Now systems like this have played
    an important role historically in the history of AI。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Going back decades， a lot of the interest in AI was around the development of
    these types of expert systems。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They've played a major role in how we think about the progress of AI。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And it's important to know about this type of AI when we start talking about
    where we are now with machine learning。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But let's put this in a recruiting example。 Let's talk about these rule-based
    systems in a potential recruiting example。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So imagine you have a set of conditions。 It might include school。 It might include
    GPA。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When I say conditions， I mean factors that use to evaluate candidates as they
    apply to your organization。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It may include school， it may include GPA， it may include prior employer。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: or signals that you pick up during the interview， the way they answer questions，
    and so on。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Some of these can be coded， meaning you can start with the resume and you can
    create measures of this。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Same thing is true of interview data。 For instance。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: experience from a prior employer in which employer they worked for could be
    encoded。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Once you have that information， a software developer can then use that data
    or use their rule-based system to evaluate or to recommend whether or not a candidate
    should be interviewed by the firm。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The key thing to know here is that you don't need data to build this system。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is what's going to differentiate it from what's coming later with machine
    learning。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this case， what we use is human expertise。 A developer sat down with a recruiter
    and basically encoded that recruiters' knowledge and expertise。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We don't need data yet to build this type of system。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is going to differentiate it from machine learning systems that are coming
    that we'll talk about a little bit later。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A system like this， this decision tree that's created by talking to an expert
    or working with an expert has some limitations。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Number one is we need access to an expert。 This presents challenges for a couple
    of reasons。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It may be hard to get access to an expert。 You can think about very specialty
    fields like specialty surgery。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: where it may be difficult to get access to an expert。 Even if you have access
    to an expert。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it's very difficult to ask people to explain everything they know about a field。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Sometimes people work on instinct。 They have huge amounts of knowledge。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but asking them to put that into rules is really more difficult than it sounds
    sometimes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That's one big drawback。 Number two is we can't easily update a system like
    this when the environment changes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you build a system like this based on these rules and then something about
    the nature of the application pool starts to change。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you have to go back and update the system or build a new system。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There's no way for it to automatically adjust to these kinds of changes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Number three is we need to know the relationships that we're thinking about。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We're basing our decisions on the expertise of a person， of an expert。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but we need to know the relationships。 We're going to start there and build
    the system。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We can't discover new relationships during this process。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Kind of related to what we're talking about before。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We can't discover new relationships as we go along。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The final thing is there's just a lot of work to create a comprehensive knowledge
    tree。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We're talking about a very deep body of knowledge。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: thinking about asking an expert to tell a developer everything they know。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/0b2aa3c97cae946b3f82cb0f738b6540_5.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: and then asking a developer to put all of this knowledge into a rule-based system。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: All of that together is a substantial amount of work。 As we'll talk about in
    the next video。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: machine learning sidesteps many of these issues。 [silence]。
