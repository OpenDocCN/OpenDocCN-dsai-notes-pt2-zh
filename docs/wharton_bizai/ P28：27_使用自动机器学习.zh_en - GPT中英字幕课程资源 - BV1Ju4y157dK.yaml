- en: Let's do an example of AutoML work just to get a sense of what the workflow
    looks like。
  prefs: []

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: and how many of the steps are automated。 So we'll do an example where we're
    using a machine learning algorithm to identify spam。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: text messages。 So as you know， email text messages。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a lot of spam coming through the system and a major。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: application of algorithms these days is automatically throwing them into a spam
    bucket。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So let's say we had a file of text messages and we wanted to build an algorithm
    to identify。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: which ones were spam and which ones were not。 So as you know。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the first thing we need is a training data set。 So we need a data set with a
    lot of text messages and then whether or not in a column essentially。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: identifying them as whether or not they are spam。 So you do need the data but
    once you have the data。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the idea behind AutoML is to make， the rest of the process as easy as possible。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So looking here with something like a AutoML platform or a solution， you do
    of course have。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to import your data。 So it's asking you here to import the data。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I've got this data that's available which is going to be the spam text messages
    and their， labels。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let me just take a quick look at it here。 So this is showing me the spam text
    messages and their labels。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So on the left here， I have a number of text messages and they are marked as
    to whether。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they are spam or ham which basically means whether they are spam or not。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so the idea is that we are going to use Google's AutoML Natural Language
    platform。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to learn from a data set like this how to identify text messages of spam or
    not and be。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: able to use that in the future。 The key thing to know is that where in the past
    we would have had to do a lot of steps。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: up until this point and after this to get the model in shape。 When you are using
    AutoML。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you essentially have you upload the data and you have a single， choice。 Ignoring
    this for now。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: this is for a model that's already been run but you essentially， have one choice
    here。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Start training。 That's really all you can do is train the model and you train
    the model what happens。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: is it goes off into Google's cloud and uses a lot of computation to figure out
    the best。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: model to use to make this kind of prediction。 So you just leave it alone。 You
    start training。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You don't have anything other choices to do or to make than to start the system
    running。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What happens then is it goes to Google's Google Cloud and then in a few hours
    you might get。

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: a response look something like this。 This response basically says hello AutoML
    Natural Language customer。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the model finished。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/0d60ee873685b5150ec47929d8f3369d_5.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: running and if you click on this link you can basically see how your model performed。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And if you come back to this page you can start to see how the model performed。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/0d60ee873685b5150ec47929d8f3369d_7.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: It gives you some statistics about the model， precision， recall， so on and you
    can evaluate。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the model as well and then you can just go ahead and use the model once you're
    happy。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: with how it's performing。 You can put it into production so that you can start
    to use it then to classify text。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: messages or spam or not。 So really the key thing to know is that with a solution
    like this is taking away almost。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: all your choices in a sense and you don't have to make too many choices。 Again。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the stated goal of something like AutoML is making machine learning available
    for people。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: who don't have any expertise。 Really once you have the data all you do is you
    start training。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you wait and it comes back， later with a message saying that it's completed。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Of course the other side of this is that because we are using Google servers
    it's going to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: come back with a bill as well。 So it's automatically in this case going to bill
    me some amount of money that according。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to how much server capacity was used to build this algorithm。 Thank you。 [BLANK_AUDIO]。
