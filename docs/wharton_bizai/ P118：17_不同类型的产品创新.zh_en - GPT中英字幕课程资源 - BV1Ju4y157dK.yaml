    about how AI can fundamentally change many industries。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    before。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And it's obviously a very important discovery。 But there are also many other
    antibiotics out there。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    to verify。
  prefs: []

- en: to put it in your wall。 But notice they all have something in common in the
    sense they are recombination innovation。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So what do I mean by recombination innovation？ That means you might be marrying
    two different things together to create a new thing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So you can think about the photos and the theory night is a great example。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You're literally putting two things together。 A photo and a theory night together
    and that gave you a new painting。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's very beautiful。 It's very innovative。 But it's a combination of two things。
    Summer was chassis。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It is still an improvement of existing chassis。 It's chassis marrying sensor。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    chassis。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Halosine again is by mining lots and lots of data points and lots and lots of
    research。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: papers about antibiotics but also many other drug interactions out there。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To find a halosine that might be very difficult to discover before but it's
    still fundamentally。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: antibiotics， not a first pedicillin。 By combining information from different
    disciplines。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: different sources of information and then， put it together to figure out what
    halosine may look like。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A same cell that you can go with P53 proteins。 Again。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    to find that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: innovation。 By doing the linkage， the tech hidden patterns among all these research
    papers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: all these， data points， we are able to find new ways to combine existing technologies
    in a new way。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That is fundamentally a recombination innovation and is very powerful for innovation。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I just gave you intuition on the type of product that AI can help you support。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Not only can AI can help you combine things in a new way， they can also do so
    by combining， many。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: many different things in a new way。 That combinatoric combination is something
    AI is really good at。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Maybe in our mind， we can do combination with three or four or five elements。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: AI can do that in hundreds of thousands。 A much more effective way to figure
    out a combinatoric combination to figure out what。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: works and what doesn't。 Let me give you an example。 What does it mean by a diverse
    recombination？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What does it mean by going through combinatoric？ For example。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: if you have four existing technologies， A， B， and C， and B， C。 A， B， and C are
    technology。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: belong to its own class。 They are very different from each other。 B。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: C is a technology that combines B and C together。 In a diverse combination。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it would be something like A， B， C that you combine all four technologies。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: three technologies together to form a diverse combination。 A very new。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a potentially radical innovation called D is a technology class that has not，
    existed before。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Our hypothesis is that AI can greatly help you to find a diverse recombination，
    combining。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: many different elements together in a new way。 It could be A， B， C， B， C， A，
    et cetera。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in a different way， different orientations。 But it may not help you find that
    first in the class innovation。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So it's great in finding hellosene， but it may not be great in helping you find
    penicillin。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: with the very first antibiotics out there。 That means a technology class that
    does not exist before。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you think about it， a technology that does not exist before doesn't have
    much data， about them。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's very limited in terms of what AI and data learners can do to help you find
    that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: radical new innovation， a D。 But it is very good at finding innovation that
    combine different。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: things together in a new way， a diverse recombination。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So how do we know that our intuition is correct that AI and analytics can facilitate
    a diverse。

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: recombination innovation？ One way to do that is using patent。 Patent has several
    advantages。 First。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that patent has a specific classification code telling you whether it is new
    or not。 In a sense。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: if the first patent showing up in that particular technology class， it is， very
    novel。 Furthermore。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we also know the patent that is current patent-sided。 So in this red box here。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we look at all the patents that this particular patent has cited。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And it's important because this is all prior art that this particular patent
    is drawing， from。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example， if a patent has ten citations all belonging to the same patent
    class， then。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we know it's not a diverse combination。 It's coming from a single technology
    class。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But the same ten patents are coming from ten different technology classes， then
    it's。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: likely that this patent is more of a diverse combination because it combines
    ten technology。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: elements together。 And that is a diverse combination。 Furthermore， to measure
    novelty。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we can also look at the abstract of the patent to look， at whether the words
    that use is very new。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/c727ae61604946cca261688ffb6d1131_17.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: For example， if the first time the word HTML showed up on abstract， that's a
    very new， word。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That means its patent is probably very novel。 If this patent is the one thousandth
    patent that mentioned the word HTML。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: then it's not， a very novel patent relatively to the first one。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So this is how we use patent data and classes by each patent into a diverse
    combination。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And since it is a combination of many， many different technology classes together，
    or。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: is it a very new technology， whether it's being the first of his own technology
    class。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: or they have used words that are so novel that have not seen in other patents
    before。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Then we examine the relationship between data analytics and AI investments to
    this two different。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: type of product innovation。 Number one being diverse combination。 Number two。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: where there's a novel technology。
  prefs: []

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: As you see in this graph here， you can see that if you look at the first one，
    it's diverse。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: combination。 And a Y axis is the likelihood of investing in AI technologies
    and other technologies。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And if you look at diverse combination， they're far more likely to adopt diverse
    combinations。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And the effect size is pretty large and the error is very small。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But if you look at the corresponding graph for novel technologies， remember
    this is the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: first of its own kind。 It's not a combination like A， B， C together。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but a brand new technology kind of D that， you haven't seen before。 In fact。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we see it's actually almost a negative relationship between novel technology
    and AI。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and lives investment， although it's virtually zero because it's so noisy we
    can't really。
  prefs: []

- en: '![](img/c727ae61604946cca261688ffb6d1131_21.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: measure it effectively。 Then let's look at the productivity effect。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Do firms that tend to combine existing technology in a new way and when they
    adopt AI analytics。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: do they correspondingly see a gain in productivity？ Okay。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And we do that same thing with whether this firm is oriented very new technology。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And we see the first bar in this graph， we can see it's the fastest dramatic。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The firm that invests in AI and also are interested in combining technologies，
    existing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: technologies in a new way， seen much bigger effect。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is about 1% change in productivity is huge given that the fact of sheer
    AI is very， small。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So it's actually a huge effect。 And if you see the same corresponding change
    on D。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: remember this is a novel technology， that we haven't seen before。 And the fact
    is almost negative。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: although it's slightly hard to tell， but it's at least， small zero。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And we see that this is not an IT phenomenon。 This is really about an AI phenomenon
    because we rapidly this graph for IT replacing AI。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: technology measurement with just general IT。 So next two graph， the bars。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you can see that this effect does not happen when you see diverse。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: combination investing in general IT technologies。 In fact。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that's almost going up the direction than AI。 And similar with novel technology。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you also don't see that in general IT investment。 So what I'm showing here is
    really about AI driving diverse recombination of these technologies。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And the firm that do both， they use AI and they use it to find diverse combination
    of。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: these technologies。 That's when they receive a dramatic increase in productivity。
    On the other hand。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: if you use AI and you're primarily using to find a novel technology， class，
    the first is own kind。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the fact doesn't seem to be there。 Similarly， you can't just invest in general
    IT。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's really about AI that is driving the fact we're seeing here。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/c727ae61604946cca261688ffb6d1131_23.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: So the main takeaway here is that we find that the analytics and AI support
    diverse recombination。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of these technologies， such as ABC， three element together。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But analytics and AI do not support radically new technologies， such as D for
    its own kind。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And we find that firm invest in analytics and AI and they focus on recombination
    innovation。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They are a lot more productive than firm that do not invest in analytics by
    itself or firm。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that are interested in recombination but do not invest in analytics。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So it's really the combination that matters most。 That you invest in AI and
    you're using it to find recombinations。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That could be another reason why the paradox exists。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You're using AI to find novel new technologies such as D。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That effort may not be as effective as you use the technology investment to
    find recombination。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: innovation。 Thank you。
