- en: In particular， I'll try and provide a high-level view of what is machine learning
    and what drives。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the accuracy of machine learning models。 For the purposes of this discussion。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I'll tend to focus only on supervised learning techniques。 There's a good reason
    for this。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If we look at the practice of AI， I would say that almost 90% or maybe even
    higher than。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 90% of practical business uses of AI tends to be machine learning。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And if you look at within machine learning， almost 90% of machine learning in
    practice。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: tends to be supervised machine learning。 So for the discussion of machine learning
    at a very high level。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I'll tend to focus our， attention on supervised machine learning algorithms。
    As I mentioned earlier。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: edit score supervised machine learning is all about taking a set。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of input variables and predicting some outcome variable。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now we do this all the time in our real life。 For example。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: if you observe dark clouds and strong winds， we might predict that maybe， it's
    going to rain。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Or we might look at what clothes somebody is wearing or better yet， how they're
    interacting。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: with us。 And we might make some inferences or predictions about whether we're
    likely to be good friends。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: with them。 Or at the workplace， we might look at a person's educational background。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We might look at their job experience at their skills and predict whether they'll
    be successful。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: at the job。 These are all typical prediction problems that we are solving on
    a day to day basis。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now there are many business applications of these kinds of predictions。 Now
    for example。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in a business setting， we are trying to predict whether somebody will， buy a
    product。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We're trying to predict whether somebody will click or add。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: All of these predictions can be made using supervised learning if we have good
    training。

- en: data。 Let's consider an example。 Suppose we have data about users coming to
    our website。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We might know how many pages have they viewed on our website in the past。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We might know their zip code based on their IP address。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We might know what device they're accessing our page from。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And we might know the operating system of that device。 And ultimately。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we're trying to predict whether this person will purchase a product， or not。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now that's a typical prediction problem one might have。 Now for the data we
    have about our users。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: meaning the input data that we use to make predictions。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One refers to these input data as the predictors of our model or the features
    in our model or。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: sometimes just the data and the variables or the covariates of the model。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are many different names， but ultimately we can think of all these variables
    as the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: inputs to our model。 Now given these inputs， we are also trying to predict something。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That's the output of our model or the outcome variable。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So we might describe the input variables using the letter X and we might describe
    the outcome。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: variable using the letter Y。 Now the prediction problem that we are facing is
    we are trying to figure out given the input。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: X we are trying to predict Y。 That is we are trying to figure out some function
    F that takes as an X as an input and predicts。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Y。 The entire task of supervised machine learning comes down to coming up with
    a highly accurate。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: approximation of this function F so that we can predict Y as accurately as possible
    given。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the inputs X。 Now the notion of accuracy is built in to what I just described。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For any prediction problem we think of accuracy as essentially a measure of
    how often are the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: predictions true or how close are the predictions to reality。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So for example if we are trying to predict whether a person purchases or not，
    if we make。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 100 prediction and 93 of those 100 predictions are correct， we might say that
    the prediction。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: accuracy of our model is 93%。 We want this prediction accuracy to be as high
    as possible and so natural question is。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to ask what drives the prediction accuracy of a model。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One factor that drives the accuracy of a machine learning model is the quantity
    of data meaning。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the number of distinct observations we have as an input into the model。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So for example if we have data on only 100 customers who have been to our website
    in， the past。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it would be very hard for us to make accurate predictions about future customers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: visiting our website based on the observations of just these 100 users。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: On the other hand if we had data for a million users then we have a lot more
    data and so clearly。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: having more observations helps increase the accuracy of our model。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another driver of prediction accuracy is how much do we know about each observation。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now in the example I just described for each consumer we only knew the number
    of pages。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they viewed in the past， we knew the operating system they use and we also happen
    to know。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: their location。 But this amount of data might not be sufficient for us to actually
    make the predictions。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: On the other hand if we had much more data about each user， for example we knew
    that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: users interests， we also knew that person's income level， we also happen to
    know whether。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they have made purchases from our website in the past and many more such observations。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/33371fd29fdcdcfa12400f3f3a0bb95f_5.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: then the prediction accuracy of our model might go up significantly。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In other words the two factors that seem to drive the accuracy of the model
    are the number。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of rows which we can think about the number of data points and the number of
    columns which。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we can think of as the number of features or the number of x variables available
    within， each row。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Together they tend to drive the accuracy of machine learning models in very
    significant， ways。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But by no means the only two factors， there's a number of other factors， for
    example how。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: relevant is the information you have available。 If we were trying to predict
    whether it's going to rain today。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: knowing how many people， are carrying umbrellas today is more useful than just
    knowing the color of the clothes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: worn by people。 So clearly having more relevant data matters。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Similarly the complexity of the model matters， if we restrict ourselves to use
    very simple。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: models they might not be able to capture very complex relationships that are
    out there。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in the environment。 So some of the more modern machine learning methods like
    deep learning which I will describe。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in a later lecture allow us to have more flexible and more complex relationships
    between the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: input variables and the outcome variables and this helps increase the prediction
    accuracy。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of models。 Another factor is what is referred to as feature engineering。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is essentially the ability of an analyst to use their domain knowledge
    to create new。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: features or new input variables that are predictive of the outcome。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This comes down to having deep domain knowledge and identifying what new data
    might we add。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to our data set or how might we transform our data set so that we can better
    make predictions。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/33371fd29fdcdcfa12400f3f3a0bb95f_7.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: In short there are many different factors that drive the success of machine
    learning models。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Certainly one has to think about many of these factors。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It always starts with having high quality and high volume data with lots of
    rows and lots。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of columns。 In the next lecture we will talk about some specific machine learning
    algorithms to give。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
