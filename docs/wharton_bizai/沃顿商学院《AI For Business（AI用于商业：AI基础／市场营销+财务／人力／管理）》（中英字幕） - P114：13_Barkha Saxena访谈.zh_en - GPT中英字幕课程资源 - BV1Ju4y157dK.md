 In 2001 at the tail end of the dot-com boom， Barka sex now began her career in data science。



![](img/d853f6534275ab907dce09a6b6ba427a_1.png)

 Now she is the chief data officer at Poshmark， a leading social marketplace for new and second-hand style。

 By combining the human connection of physical shopping， with the scale， ease。

 and selection benefits of e-commerce， Poshmark makes buying and selling simple social。

 and sustainable。 Each person in the ecosystem is potentially。

 on both sides of the marketplace as a buyer and a seller。 Barka， welcome。 - Thank you， Mary。

 for such a wonderful introduction。 Well， I'm very excited to talk not only about your career。

 but your impact at Poshmark。 There's a lot of been going on。

 especially this year in spite of a pandemic。 So to ground us in your perspective。

 can you tell us a little bit about your current role， at Poshmark as the chief data officer。

 and impact you and your team have since you've joined？ - Yeah， absolutely。

 So I'm responsible for the overall data strategy， for Poshmark， and I manage a centralized team。

 of data scientist， machine learning， analytics， and data tools。

 And we work across all business functions。 The charter of my team is to deliver higher ROI。

 at a much faster pace。 I joined Poshmark in 2014， when he was still like pretty early。

 a small series big company of like 30， 35 people， from there to today where we just IPO'd in generally。

 It has been a long journey。 And what brought me to Poshmark was， it was Manisha's powerful vision。

 on bringing the social to the commerce in mobile space。 And if you think about it。

 those were very early days for mobile commerce。 And I clearly saw the role the data is going to play。

 in that world。 Like today we are a company which has 80 plus million users。

 and we have 300 plus million products， across 9，000 plus bands。

 Our users spent 27 minutes on the platform every day。 And in 2020。

 we saw 30 billion interactions from these users。 So you can just imagine the amount of data it creates。

 And within that is the opportunity， to be able to work across all business functions。

 from marketing to product to operations to community service。

 and use all of this data to deliver our buyers， and sellers a beautiful experience。 So yeah。

 we have been busy in like last seven years， starting from building the data infrastructure。

 That's the first thing which I did， to now just to delivering a lot of data solutions。

 of various kinds from the analytics， the statistic analysis to the machine learning models。

 to bring a lot of value to each of these functions。 - And I think that's really you've set up。

 all the different issues that you had to deal with， given the pandemic basically overnight。

 And that really helps us lead into， to peel back the onion a bit。

 which one of the first things I really wanna talk to you about， is the algorithms that helped you。

 with your operational efficiencies， and servicing your customers and engaging your users。

 So customers in your ecosystem， they can potentially be both sides。

 your buyers and the sellers in the marketplace。 So how do you train the algorithms。

 to recognize the data of a consumer， that could potentially be both a buyer and a seller。

 which I'm sure happens often。 And so if you could just tell us a little bit。

 in a little bit more detail without giving away， your secret sauce。

 how do you and your team train these models， to recognize the nuances of the data。

 that a provider can find in a seller。 - If it's such a great feeling。

 we find that as a strength in the platform， because people are buying and selling in the same platform。

 So they're super engaged。 And to answer a specific question on like， how do we train the algorithms？

 Mary， you talked to so many other practitioners， that I'm sure you are aware of this。

 that answers to all of these questions， to start with the data itself。

 No algorithm will do anything， if we did not have the data。 So what we have done， as I mentioned。

 I started my journey at Poshmark， with actually building the data infrastructure。 Like。

 and in building that， we have built the data infrastructure。

 that it's a very well-thought event schema， which is what you use to collect the new data。

 as well as data modeling terms of how you are， enriching the data。

 And then the final step is the data tables， like the way the data gets stored。

 whether it's temporary or the real time。 But we spent a lot of time， energy。

 and hours and hours of conversation， in coming up with the structure， that even if it's the same。

 we are collecting all the information， and all the seller intent。 And so by using that。

 just having the data infrastructure， which allows us to be able to distinguish。

 that's the first thing。 And then from there， when we start to build out these algorithms。

 it starts with， hey， what is it we are trying to do？ Before you build up an algorithm。

 you have a business question in mind。 And if that business question is the buying focused。

 then we create our features， and go through the whole feature engineering， et cetera。

 in such a way that you are mainly focusing， on the buying site features。 To give you an example。

 we have a beautiful personal recommendation， of go-in company， which every day recommends。

 all the buyers a set of curated items， which are suited for your taste。

 based on all the signals you have given us in the past。 When we pull data for that。

 we only pull the data， which is related with your buying action。 So the interest。

 whether it's the social connections， or the commerce actions or the liking， et cetera。

 you have done with other people's closets， other people's items， not within your class。

 Because we are looking for the signal on， who else you are interacting with。

 Because when you go to other people's closets， that's when you are interested in buying things。

 So we use the buying side of signal。 And again， the data infrastructure。

 and the way we store the data allows us to just pull the data， which is from the buying side of it。

 When it comes to the selling site， for example， we have listing score。

 where we try to understand the quality of the listing。

 That's where the seller side of the actions matter。

 And that's where we know like the seller share things， seller follow people。

 And when you're creating a content， there's a lot of information about that。

 So we pull the seller side of the attributes， to create the features to build out the model。

 And of course， the objective function， of each of these algorithms。

 ensures that we are training them， for the buying side versus the selling side。 Having said that。

 there are some cases， where we do have to look at the both sides together。

 And the customer segmentation， we have this core user segmentation， which is a case。

 Because when you think about the core user， you're not saying core buyer or the core seller， right？

 You are talking about the core user。 And that's where we actually do create the features。

 coming from the both sides。 And we train those algorithms。

 based on the multiple objective functions。 And after doing this。

 we actually go through a lot of discussions， with our business stakeholders on the both sides。

 and get their feedback。 And that's， these are the places， where I think that the business expertise。

 and the knowledge really matters。 And sometimes what I might call。

 like the cherry picking of the features， which is giving us the good perspective on the both sides。

 And then we finally train the model， so that we have a picture of a core user with poor dimensions。

 But that's， that's， so I'm in general， a big fan of what people call the explainable AI。

 I need to be， I should be able to explain anyone， the most complicated model in plain English。

 if I need to。 But that becomes even more critical， when you have the situation。

 where each user is being looked at， from two different lenses of the buyer and the seller。

 - And I think that really helps us understand one is how you。

 how you framed your data and categorized your data， and organized your data。

 So it can be used on both sides。 But really it was these buyer signals。

 that when they're looking at someone else's closet， that you identified that as the intent。

 And then working with your subject matter experts。

 or experts about which specific data pieces or data objects。

 are most critical to answering the question。 I suspect if you could talk maybe about。

 when you talk about the explainability of a model。

 is this something that is an objective within Poshmark， for both not only your team， but that these。

 the subject matter experts， that people understand how these models work。

 or that explainability is that just within your team， that they're the ones that can explain models。

 Does everyone understand how these models work， within Poshmark？ - So yes， so we actually。

 it's a conscious effort， that no model is ever called the final model。

 until it has gone through a review， with what we call the business team。

 They could be the business stakeholders， or they could be the product team。

 Because having been this field for 20 plus years， it's super valuable to hear it from the people。

 who are doing this in day to day job。 When you are trying to build something。

 around the customer retention， you really need to be talking to the marketing people。

 who are taking those actions， because they have some learning， which is going to help us make sure。

 that you are building a model， which is going to stand， which is going to hold up over time。

 And it's not just completely driven， by the historical data。

 which can change as soon as marketing person changes， the strategy in the case of marketing。

 So it's super important to bring them in the picture。

 And that's why we do form the team and have the process， so that it's a part of the written process。

 That it's not done until it has gone through that review。 - Okay， so can you explain now， Tiffany。

 but can you explain why Poshmark's mobile app， which is very， very important from the onset。

 was so important in the early engagement with buyers。 And then as a second question around that is。

 how does AI and machine learning really facilitate， that seamless journey for those buyers？ - Yep。

 great question。 And honestly， I have been， I mean， I came at Poshmark。

 when you were already on the mobile strategy。 So I have also been impressed with how visionary Manish was。

 So he always， in the 2010， which is when he started on Poshmark。

 web was the main way people shopped。 And the mobile had come in， but it wasn't that great。

 And people will find things on web， and then they will use mobile for a little bit， right？

 Maybe you are rechecking things， et cetera。 But he clearly saw that as the mobile phones continue。

 to improve， that will be the way people will shop。 So he basically made a bet on the mobile。

 that it's going to become the device， where people will do the main shopping。

 And when the iPhone 4 launched， which is was the first phone。

 which came with a good camera and the good visual， good screens that you could look at the item。

 and the quality was like really high。 That's why it became very clear that， hey。

 now we are ready to bet， because it looks like it's a device。

 where what many thought could come true。 So we went full in into just the mobile first strategy。

 and our users responded because from the buying perspective。

 they found it pretty easy to be able to scroll， a lot of listings and vows so many styles on the go。

 You don't have to be sitting。 And that's where the fashion was headed， right？

 When you get the fashion inspiration， it can happen anywhere， right？

 It doesn't wait for you to get home。 So bias definitely responded to that。

 And the sellers love that ease of being able， to just take a quick picture wherever you are。

 and being able to list it like in 60 seconds。 So it worked out from the both ends。

 but I would say it was malicious vision， and the bet he took that mobile。

 I guess he had a lot of confidence in Apple， and coming up with that beautiful phone。

 - So I love how you categorized， he really had the post-arts， mantras， meet fashion where you are。

 And because of that and the foresight， to use it as such a critical platform。

 could you explain a little bit more in terms of， did the machine learning。

 do you have to double down on the machine learning， and the AI to make it this seamless journey。

 or what are the current pressures on your team， to make sure that that journey is fruitful。

 as going forward as you're coming out of the pandemic？ - Yep， so that is true。

 As I mentioned the amount of data， right？ When you have the 30 billion interactions。

 happening on the platform， you need to be able to use that data。

 because that's the only way you're gonna be able， to deliver a seamless experience to the user。

 But when you come to the platform as a buyer， and you have your personalized feed。

 you expect it to be personalized to what you like， and you will expect that， hey。

 I have been using your platforms for this much time， that you obviously know that what I like。

 what I don't like， so personalize it for me。 Similarly， when you search。

 that two people can search on the word black， but they will expect different things， right？

 Depending on the context。 So there's an expectation from the user， that what we should deliver。

 So we respond to that and the only way， to respond to that when you have the 80 million plus users。

 and the amount of data you are sitting with， is to actually use that data。

 You use the signals in the past， to deliver the buyer experience， so that it's curated for you。

 but at the same time you are still leaving the room， for the discovery， right？ Otherwise。

 if you just keep showing the users， what users are interacting in the past。

 how are you gonna get exposed to the new things？ So we bring the balance of the two in the recommendations。

 because Poshmark is also the place， to find the new fashion inspirations， right？ So， and I mean。

 use the machine learning， to deliver that experience in a variety of the shopping， I would say。

 not the channel， but you know， there are so many ways buyers in track。

 Whether it's the personalized feed， or we are making you recommendations or you are searching。

 but it's basically the way you engage with the buyer。 When it comes on the seller side。

 they create all these listings， and they are investing all this time in marketing。

 they are listings on the platform， whether it's through sharing or they are engaging。

 with the buyers on one on one， and they are offering these discounts。

 And that's where we use all of our data， to be able to help our sellers in being more efficient。

 in when they want to make， when they want to offer the discount。

 Poshmark pairs it up with some kind of shipping discount。

 So that it increases the chances of them being able， to sell the items at a much faster pace。 Again。

 with like this， with the 200 plus million items， which are selling at， which are listed at Poshmark。

 we need to bring in the data and the machine learning， to make sure that the items are selling。

 And at the end， it goes back to， it's the， like what I like to call it。

 it's the matching of the buyer and the seller， or the matching of the item to what buyer is looking for。

 And the only way you can do this， like we internally we use these bird birds。

 like the demand match and the supply match。 And there is no other way of doing it efficiently。

 or at the high quality without using the machine learning。

 because the reason machine learning is useful， because when the data is so vast。

 you can't write rules to work on it。 You need to build the intelligence。

 and bring it in such a way that over time， it will continue to learn and get better and better。

 as we learn more about the user， and more about the trends which are changing， in the environment。

 And we are in the fortunate place， where the users are giving us so much data。

 And fortunately we have done a good job， of like managing and maintaining the data。

 and is structuring it in such a way， that we can make use of it。 And along with that， like。

 you know， the some of the processes， et cetera， which I hinted to that I talked about， like。

 you know， before solving any problem， we start with the very top。

 like what is the business question we are trying to solve。 And believe it or not， so many times。

 people actually don't spend enough time there。 And then you can end up building a model。

 which is not exactly answering the problem。 So we are obsessed with the spending a lot of time。

 in honing down on， okay， this is exactly the problem we are trying to solve。

 And then we look at it from the architecture diagram。

 perspective that how is it gonna get integrated， with the decisions。

 Sometimes it's a product feature。 Sometimes it's something which you are giving it。

 to your marketing managers or your product managers。

 who are going to make use of it for the decision。 But that whole picture has to be clear。

 before you actually start to pull the data， and build out the model。

 And then I talked about the whole video process， with the business stakeholders and internally。

 We spend a lot of time in that。 Again， with the goal of like， as Poshma continues to scale。

 users continue to give us more and more signal。 Things have to automatically continue to scale。

 So it's not that we have to break and rebuild things。 We have to build that。

 build them with this growth， and the scaling in mind so that we continue to delay。

 by the our buyer and sell this amazing experience， which they expect from us。 - With that。

 I really like to thank you very much， Barca， for your time today。 - Thank you， Mary。

 It's always a pleasure to talk to you。 (buzzing)， (buzzing)。
