- en: So before any sort of machine learning or AI or more generally financial analytics
    exercise。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we always want to have a process for how we attack a problem or question。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And I think the most tried and true method is what most people refer to as the
    scientific。

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: method。 And I love this quote by Richard Feynman， the great physicist， which
    sort of summarizes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the scientific method very succinctly and eloquently。 If it and by it， he meant
    theory。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: disagrees with experiment， it's wrong。 And that simple statement is the key
    to science。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And that characterization of sort of the scientific approach to tackling problems，
    I think， is。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: incredibly useful for tackling business problems as much as it is for tackling
    scientific， problems。

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: So let's be a little more explicit here。 So what is the scientific method？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There's many ways to describe it， the one I find quite useful is the following。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So first you start by clearly articulating a specific question。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What problem are you trying to solve？ Then you guess an answer。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Statisticians would say you hypothesize an answer。 Same idea。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So you come up with some potential answers or hypotheses， solutions， proposed
    solutions。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to the problem。 Step three， we want to then identify the empirical implications
    of those hypotheses or those guesses。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to the answers to the question。 In other words， if the answer or hypothesis
    is correct。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: what should we see in the data？ And then finally， we want to compare the empirical
    implications of our guesses with what we actually。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: see in the data。 In other words， if our hypothesis is correct， this is what
    we see in the data。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: should see， in the data， but do we actually see it in the data？ And that's really
    the last step。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So let's consider an example and apply the scientific method。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

- en: Here's a question one might have。 Why is our revenue growth slowing？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And question many business leaders might ask of their company。 Now it seems
    like a clear。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: specific question， but in fact， I have a lot of questions about， that question。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's not quite as clear as you might think if we want to go to the data to try
    and extract。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: an answer to that question。 So for example， what revenue？ Are we talking about
    consolidated？ Gross。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: net， net of returns， discounts， et cetera。 Over what time period？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So are we talking about revenue growth just over the last year or over the last
    two years。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: five years？ And so if we want to take to the data， so to speak， this question，
    we need to be very。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: specific and clear about the question。 So let's imagine that what we're really
    interested in here is why is revenue growth over the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: last three years？ Apologies for the typing。 And let's say it's consolidated
    at the aggregate level。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: not for a particular product。 Why is consolidated revenue growth over the last
    three years slowing？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And eventually I'll learn how to type here。 This is our question。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Remember that step two was to guess an answer。 What are some potential answers？
    Why do you think。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in fact， pause the video and try and come up with some answers？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And the fact that you don't know what specific company we're discussing here
    is not relevant。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Just use your general business sense and understanding of what drives revenue
    at a very general level。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to try and come up with some answers to this question。 Okay， hopefully you're
    back。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you came up with some， what are some potential answers here？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Some hypotheses as to why revenue growth is slowing。 Maybe one thing that's
    going on is that demand。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: product demand is slowing。 Maybe something else that could be going on is actually
    demand is not slowing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but we're， having a supply problem。 So there's a lot of demand for our products。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but we just can't get product to the shelf， for some reason。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Maybe what's going on is there's been a change in pricing strategy。 Remember。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: revenue is priced times quantity。 So a reduction in revenue over time or slowing
    of growth。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: more precisely， could come through， either the quantity or price channel。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So there's a few hypotheses that we can test。 And then the third step was to
    identify the empirical implications of our guesses。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Well the empirical implications of these different hypotheses are actually relatively
    straightforward。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So if there's a change in pricing strategy， we can look at the data at the pricing
    of。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: our products to see if we have been reducing prices， perhaps too aggressively
    to maintain， demand。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So we should see reductions in product prices。 Maybe what's going on is that
    instead we're seeing a slowdown in products sold quantities。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And what's interesting is this is the same implication we would see for a supply
    problem。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Growth will affect quantities。 And so if it turns out to be the case that we're
    just selling less units。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we're going， to have to probe a little bit more deeply later on。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But there are some potential hypotheses behind our revenue growth slowing question
    as well。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/7ea78cd1b6bc7d6a80b9d11771b1220f_7.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: as some empirical implications of those hypotheses。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And then the last step is to compare the implications with the data。 That's
    our last step。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/7ea78cd1b6bc7d6a80b9d11771b1220f_9.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: So we'll have to actually look at some data on product sales， on product prices
    to see， what。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: if any of these hypotheses are actually playing true in the data。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now that's a very stylized example， but hopefully an illustrative one to emphasize
    the importance。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of one clearly articulating a specific question that you can take to the data。
    Two。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: guessing some answers to the question or hypothesizing。 Three。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: identifying the empirical implications of those hypotheses。 That is what we
    should see in the data。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And four， eventually taking those implications to the data to see if which，
    if any， are in。
