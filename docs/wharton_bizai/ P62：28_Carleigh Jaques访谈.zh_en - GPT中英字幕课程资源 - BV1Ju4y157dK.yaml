  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Carli joined Visa to lead strategy and corporate development。 Four years ago。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: she assumed the general manager role at CyberSource， which is Visa's global。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: merchant and acquirer platform。 Welcome， Carli。 To Grom is in your perspective。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: can you tell us about your role at Visa and the business， CyberSource that you
    lead？ Absolutely。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: thank you so much， Mary。 So CyberSource is what we would call a payment management
    platform or sometimes in the industry。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we would call it a gateway。 What that really means is if you think about the
    traditional countertop experience where。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you tap or dip your card with that device on the counter， that is routing a
    payment， transaction。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What CyberSource is is effectively the digital version of that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So if you think about a mobile experience， whether it's waking up in the morning
    and buying。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: your coffee or your transit ticket or perhaps paying your parking， buying a
    sweater later。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in the day， getting a snack from a vending machine， chances are we power that
    transaction。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And in 2020， we powered about 21 billion transactions worth approximately $600
    billion in payment。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: volume。 Wow， those are some really big numbers。 So given that and a very big
    job。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: what is the biggest value driver to Visa and indirectly。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: CyberSource's customers related to AI applications and possibly how is AI being
    applied to address。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: solve problems for your customers？ Like for example。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: what are some use cases that Visa is deploying specifically through。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the use of AI and machine learning？ In the digital world。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the merchant bears the liability of a bad transaction。 So merchants really care
    a lot about this。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Acquires who are the folks who underwrite merchants care a lot about this。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So it was organic for CyberSource to participate actively in fraud tools in
    support of merchants。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and acquires。 We processed about 200 billion in payment volume last year again
    on the fraud front。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That's about two billion transactions。 And the types of work we're doing is
    to really look at transactions again across the globe。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to be thinking about fraud signals from over 250 different sources and applying
    that to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a situation。 And one of the things that's happened in COVID perversely is we've
    seen a massive spike。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in e-com traffic。 We've unfortunately also seen a massive spike in fraudulent
    activity。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So in our experience， what we've seen is that merchants are deploying our capabilities
    in。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the traditional manner。 But they've also been incredibly creative in terms of
    partnering with us to develop new。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: use cases。 So early on in the pandemic， kind of a fun one is that there was
    a lot of hoarding behavior。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: happening。 And one of our clients used our capabilities to dial in very granularly
    at the skew level。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and look at hoarding behavior and basically cap the number of bottles of Clorox
    that you。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: could buy so that it was available for the broader community。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So it's a capability set that was developed for a specific use case， but the
    flexibility。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of our technology has really made it adaptable to a whole host of scenarios。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So given that exact example that you've shared， seems like COVID has really
    accelerated how。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: visa and cyber sources had to approach AI differently from five years ago。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So more specifically around that， are you finding you're more iterative with
    your customers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: now versus five years ago？ And what has allowed you to be more agile？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And when you do pull in your data scientists into those customer business problems，
    do you。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: pull them in earlier or how has it changed over these last five years？ I know
    COVID is accelerated。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but maybe give people some perspective over that five year， period。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So I would say just foundationally， our development approach has changed pretty
    radically。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And when you sit in an industry that is very technical， that is very complex，
    it's a very。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: complex ecosystem。 It's very easy to build from a lens that I would call inside
    out。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Our teams loved to go to the whiteboard and draw the flows of the way the transaction
    was。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: going to navigate across the globe。 And what we've really seen is that it's
    critically important to think about the customer experience。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To think about， we use the term a lot， customer journeys。 And really。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: what is that experience of interacting with our technology？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What is the business problem very specifically that we're trying to solve？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And those types of approaches have absolutely transformed the experience of
    our products。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: just across the board。 So again， it's a lot of things like JAD sessions， right？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Join application development session with our client， with our technologists
    and our product。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: development teams。 And data scientists are absolutely in the mix in those types
    of sessions because the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: way fraud works is it's very industry specific。 And unless we understand the
    business context of our clients。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we might have phenomenal technology， but we're not actually optimizing against
    the outcome we're looking for。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So when you talk about the business context and you've set that up with this
    context of。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: processes and your data scientists， can you talk and your customers？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Can you talk about a little bit more about how important it is to frame the
    business problem。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and potentially who is involved in helping to frame that business problem， why
    it is so， important？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So again， fraud is very industry specific。 And if you're the emergent in the
    transaction environment。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: what you're thinking about is， how do I optimize and accept as many good transactions
    as possible？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And then how do I weed out the bad transactions？ But the cost of a bad transaction
    can be very different depending on your industry。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you have digital goods， right， you're incredibly high margin and a bad transaction。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: really is not as impactful to your business。 On the flip side of it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: if you're in a very thin margin business， every bad transaction。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: is incredibly impactful to your bottom line。 So that's the type of thing you
    need to understand。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And again， that iterative element of business context is just incredibly important。
    So again。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: harkening back maybe a little bit to a COVID example of also just how dynamic。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: business context can be。 Even if your industry has stayed the same。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the things we saw early on was that there were a lot of one way international。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: airline tickets happening。 And we have a very large footprint in the airline
    industry。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's a place where there actually is a reasonable amount of fraud。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: People steal a credential by a ticket and then move on。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So a lot of international one way tickets normally would be a very bad outcome
    and those。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: would have sailed through。 And in fact， what happened is that the models were
    blocking them。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But we looked at it and we said in COVID， this is actually a lot of people who
    are just。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: trying to get home。 We need to change the way the models are working to support
    a very current business environment。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So again， just context is an evergreen phenomenon， I guess would be the point。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So from your experience， can you highlight the key elements to building out
    not only good。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: models and why it's critical， but that your model is only as good as your data。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And maybe provide an example of why normalization of data is so important。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So I mean data is kind of the secret sauce and your model is only as good as
    your data。 I mean。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the way I simplistically think about this is， you know， it's algebra。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And if you don't have a good set of values you are solving for， then you're
    going to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: be off the mark really just from the get go。 And in our industry。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: one of the things that we've seen is we really do need to understand， the data。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: understand where what we would call truth data comes into place。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So if there is a bad transaction in the credit card industry， it actually has
    to be reported。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to your bank by the consumer or by the merchant。 That process to adjudicate
    the outcome often takes about 90 days。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So you can have a 90 day period where you don't know whether it was in fact
    a legitimately。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: good transaction or a bad transaction。 And where this becomes really relevant
    is that if you have a merchant。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: for example， who's， setting up a mobile channel。 That actually can have a different
    fraud vector than an e-comm channel or a face-to-face channel。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so as you think about your insights that you're taking away from your data
    and analytics。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the model gets better once you cross that 90 day marker because you've seen
    how fraud。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: is working specifically in that channel。 And again。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the big takeaway is that you need to understand how your models are working
    before。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you decide the value they're driving in terms of a business outcome。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And that's really one of the key things we've focused on is listening to our
    data scientists。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and understanding where our models are in terms of their maturity。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And then also development of new data insights， for example。 We might also ingest
    a new data set。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We want to see if that data set produces the lift that we expect。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's not enough for it to be a hypothetical。 And as you break down the good
    data that you're speaking about。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: finally， can you tell us just， a bit more about your data definitions。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: data governance at Visa and CyberSource and their， importance。 I mean， we take
    data definition。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: data governance extremely seriously。 We have a vast set of data。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We're also incredibly mindful of privacy and all of those different dimensions
    that go。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: around data usage。 And then there is this whole element of normalization， again。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: because we have -- it's not something， average consumer might know。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but they're almost -- they're at least 20 different ways you could， affect a
    transaction。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And they all have different attributes。 When those get rolled up to think about
    a card not present transaction。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: so think maybe， more of a digital transaction or a face-to-face transaction。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you don't have those mapped correctly across different data sources， you're
    going。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to destroy your outcomes。 And then similarly， if you think about ingesting incremental
    data sources。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: which is something， we do regularly， and there are just more and more ways to
    think about augmenting data today。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example， what are the attributes of the device that you're working on？ Where
    is it coming from？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What IP address has it hit？ Is the behavior of the consumer on that web property
    consistent with the way we traditionally。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: see a real person interact versus a bot interact？ All of those are the types
    of data we can apply to augment。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But if our definitions don't have the same baseline， we will get distortion。
    So we're very。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: very focused on that。 It's amazing， Carly， all the things that you have to consider
    when making a credit card。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: transaction。 I don't think I'll ever look at those machines simply again and
    just know all the different。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: things that occur。 But I just want to thank you so much for enlightening us
    how AI and ML is applicable within Visa。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and CyberSource and credit card transactions。 And thank you for your time today。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It was great getting to know you and the business。 So thank you so much。 Thank
    you， Mary。
