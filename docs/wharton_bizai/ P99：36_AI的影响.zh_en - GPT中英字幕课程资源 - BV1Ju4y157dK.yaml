    concern that the rise of artificial。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    et cetera。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: These are attention-getting predictions。 Some of them are extremely dramatic。
    I mean。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we've heard things a few years ago that 40% of jobs are going to go away in，
    the next few years。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: et cetera。 The big takeaway right at the beginning is， at least so far， all
    those predictions， the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: attention-getting ones， have been wrong。 But nevertheless， they get a lot of
    attention。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So we want to talk about what we know， but also how to think about these predictions，
    because。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they're not going to go away。 We're going to keep seeing them。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so part of what we want to do in this section is to get a sense about how
    should。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we think about these predictions when we hear them。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The first thing to know is to maybe spend a couple of minutes just talking about
    predicting。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the future。 There are some things we're pretty good at。 Actorial science， for
    example。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What is the likelihood that my house will burn down？ Well， we can estimate that
    pretty well。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: because there have been enough houses around and enough， of them burned down。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and the circumstances are relatively similar， that we can assess， based on attributes
    of my house。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: pretty accurately what the chances are that it might burn down， in a given period
    of time。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Economic forecasting does roughly the same kind of thing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We're assuming that the future will look like the past。 And so we build a model。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: like machine learning models in some ways， trying to predict something。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: like the growth in the economy， GNP growth based on a bunch of factors。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We build that model if it worked pretty well for the past， then we take it into
    the future。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: by plugging in measures for the variables in the model today to see what that
    says about。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: growth rates。 The problem with those， of course， is that if the future does
    not look like the past。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the forecasting models won't work very well。 That's an issue there。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If we're looking at a prediction on a topic where there's not enough data to
    build a forecasting。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: model， near future events， for example， or something like what will the political
    reaction。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of the Democrats be to this situation， something like that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Then we're into the realm of asking people， market research and polling， you
    know， for， asking。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: trying to figure out how the election will go， polling data is pretty good，
    how are。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you going to vote？ Market research is pretty good。 Would you buy this product
    if it was there。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: right？ The problem is sometimes we're asking about things which are bigger events。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They don't happen very often。 And there are things which polling is not going
    to work for， right？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And that is something like the introduction of new technology。 These are expert
    judgment questions。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Our colleague here at Worden， Phil Tatlock， has studied these for decades and
    he's run。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: big experiments on them。 And he's also run some recently to try to understand
    what kind of people。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: with what kind of attributes， are good at expert judgments。 That is predicting，
    for example。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: will the United States move toward the left？ Will a particular country elect
    a different parliament？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Will there likely be a war in the Middle East？ That kind of stuff。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And here's what he finds about people who are good at this。 First， people who
    are highly confident。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: who are deep subject matter experts， they know， a lot about the topic。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And people who are guided by theory， they do worse。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: People who do better are people who are questioning assumptions， people who
    consider the counter。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: arguments， and people who look for similar situations elsewhere。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: They do better。 So when you're looking at a prediction from somebody or some
    organization。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: what you want， to do is start looking down and saying。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: do they consider in their arguments the counter， arguments？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Do they question the assumptions that are built into the model that they're
    using？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Or do they at least articulate them？ Are they looking for similar situations
    elsewhere？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If they are pretty good chance their judgment might be worth listening to， if
    they don't。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: do any of those things， pretty good chance in Phil's estimation。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is like throwing monkeys throwing darts， who says description， this is
    just random。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So where do the predictions come from？ Well here's something to remember about
    contemporary society。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There's a big competition for eyeballs in the private sector。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And that means if you can get attention， there's money behind that。 And the
    money tends to win too。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So if these are predictions by people who are selling you something， they have
    an interest。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in particular stories。 And let me just point something out。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I have yet to see a consultant report that says things。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: are pretty much going to be the same going forward。 And I've never seen one
    that says， you know。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: not much to worry about here。 And the reason is those don't sell。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They don't get eyeballs and they don't get much attention， even when they're
    true。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So let me give you a couple of examples of these in the workplace that I have
    been around。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One was in the early 2000s。 There were a lot of organizations predicting that
    there was going to be a coming labor shortage。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And of course it never happened。 And that was because they were misreading。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: initially they were misreading some of the demographic， data from the census
    basically。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And then other people started to pile out and say， yeah， coming labor shorts。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And everybody had a report on the coming labor shortage。 And of course it never
    happened。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And people who understood demographics knew it was not going to happen。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But that didn't prevent companies from building plans about how they were going
    to deal with。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: this coming labor shortage because everybody was talking about it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Talk about another one which is popular。 And this is millennials and these generational
    differences。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The National Academy of Sciences published a report this past summer looking
    into this。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And they concluded basically none of this is true。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There's no evidence that millennials even exist as a distinct generation compared
    to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: those born before or after them。 There's nothing to any of this generational
    story。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And yet it persists。 And the reason it persists is it sounds cool。 It sounds
    interesting。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It sounds like things we kind of know even though there's no evidence that it's
    true。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And all the evidence we have suggests it's not true。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Just a couple of years ago we had this big concern that driverless trucks were
    going。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to eliminate truck drivers。 And I know companies where they had tasked their
    HR people to try to figure out what。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they were going to do with all their unemployed truck drivers because technology
    was going。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to eliminate trucks。 And these predictions were that it was going to happen
    very quickly。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And of course we haven't heard a thing about it since。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Maybe partly because other news was more important but also we've seen no progress
    on that front。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So let's talk about the general predictions about artificial intelligence but
    let's back。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: up a little bit following my colleague Phil Tatlok and looking at what we know
    from similar。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: situations before。 So we've spent a lot of time over the last generation or
    so looking at the effects of。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: introducing information technology。 What are the effects that that has had on
    jobs？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Well overall in the economy has it eliminated jobs？ No。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The total number of jobs in the economy continue to grow。 We'll talk about why
    that is in a bit。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You might say well how about in particular occupations？ Certainly you can see
    some of that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The biggest one in my lifetime that I've seen is typist jobs went away。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But the reason typist jobs went away is not because word processing eliminated
    typing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It was word processing led management to decide that even executives should
    now do their own。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: typing。 So it was a management decision pushed along by software。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But that's going to be a key point the biggest changes come when technology
    pushes management。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to make different decisions about work organizations。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But one of the things also to remember about IT and this will certainly be true
    going forward。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: is that IT is not per se designed to eliminate jobs。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In many cases what it is designed to do is introduce new functions that didn't
    exist， before。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example even earlier on when you could buy and order things online one of
    the things。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that you did not see was software making recommendations to you。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That said people who buy this also buy that。 Have you thought about getting
    the tools that you need to put this thing together？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Those recommendations that you get all the time did not exist before， didn't
    eliminate， any jobs。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The IT there added functionality and the effects of applying IT to existing
    jobs don't necessarily。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: eliminate those jobs。 That's something we want to think about pretty carefully。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If we think about how this works for example and you think about how information
    technology。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and AI more broadly what it does is not designed to eliminate jobs even in the
    context of robotics。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Robots you would think are designed to eliminate jobs。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: An assembly line get rid of the person put a robot in there。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It turns out that is not happening at least in the studies that we can see so
    far。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you look at the number of robots going into a place and you look at the number
    of jobs。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they are not offsetting it。 Part of the reason for that is what the robots are
    doing is helping take over one task out。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of the employees。 Lifting the tires on an assembly line robot is doing that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They are doing eliminated welding early on but here is a great story to remember
    and that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: is the triumph of Toyota over General Motors robots。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the 1980s General Motors decided that it was going to eliminate as many production。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: workers as it could from its assembly plants because you couldn't trust workers
    and their。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: quality was bad。 They invested hugely in robotics。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: $43 billion to put robots in their assembly plants。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Toyota came into the United States and took over General Motors plant in Fremont，
    California。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that had made old mobiles and Toyota started making Corollas for General Motors。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They called them novos but they were Toyota Corollas made by Toyota with American
    workers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and with the old equipment that was there from the 1970s but using lean production。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: At the same time General Motors spent $43 billion automating it plant。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Because lean production was more productive， cheaper and higher quality than
    the General。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Motors robots。 It isn't the case that robots always beat employees even on things
    like quality and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: productivity。 Part of the reason is that people are really， really adaptable。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Even if we think about simple tasks， low skilled tasks， where you think equipment
    and IT and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: robots could do them， there's lots of things that robots could do that we're
    not having， them do。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And one of the reasons why is labor is pretty cheap。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We could have room bots sweeping all our floors rather than janitors。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Janitors are still pretty cheap and it's easier to have them do it than it is
    to try to get。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: robots to do it because robots are still pretty expensive。 Same thing with driverless
    cars。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Is there actually a market for driverless cars？ And here the answer is it's
    not so clear。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Sure there are some people who would want them but let's take the best selling
    vehicles。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in the United States。 They are all trucks。 We've all seen truck ads on television。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The truck ads on television are some pretty burly guy with a cowboy hat on driving
    a truck。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: bouncing on a construction site， going through and pulling something really
    big at the end， of it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Suppose you could make a driverless truck。 Who's going to buy that truck？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Are any of those people who are attracted to those truck ads going to be interested
    in。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a truck where Skippy the Robot is driving and in the ad sitting next to him
    is somebody。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: who is doing their nails while Skippy drives over the construction site。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The people who buy trucks want to drive on themselves。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The people who buy sports cars want to drive on themselves。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I'm saying there's zero market for driving cars that are driverless but it's
    not an infinite。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: market。 And a big question is simply because things are possible to do with
    robotics and artificial。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: intelligence doesn't mean that there's a market for it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Or does it mean that it's going to be cheap enough to do especially when labor
    is still。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: pretty cheap？

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: One of the claims that we hear the most is that AI is different。 This time it's
    different。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The problem with that going back to our colleague Phil Tettlock and his views
    about what makes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: for a good prediction is whenever you get a claim that something is unique，
    so e-generous， right？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's completely unlike what we have ever seen before。 You want to question that，
    right？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the things to question as we said before is that what artificial intelligence
    is likely。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to do and what data science can do right now is focus on one task， right？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So look for example at radiologists。 So well-known studies showing that radiologists。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: if you compare radiologists screening for one， particular illness like breast
    cancer that an algorithm does that better than radiologists。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: do it。 They don't do it hugely better but they do it better， okay？ Now。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: is that going to eliminate radiologists？ Well the second part of the finding
    which you don't hear as much about is that radiologists。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: working with algorithms are even better than either of them working separately，
    right？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And the third thing to remember is that radiologists do a whole bunch of stuff
    other than reading。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: x-rays。 They also handle， they make diagnoses of course as well。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: only some part of which is based on， what the screens tell them。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Some part of what they do as well is they do treatments with radiology as well，
    right？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So it might very well be the case that some of their tasks get automated but
    that doesn't。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: mean that everything they do gets automated。 Driverless trucks for example，
    right？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Most of the truck drivers in the United States are delivery drivers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So what they do is they drive to your house， maybe a robotic driver can do that
    but then。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they get out， they unload your packages， they put them on the steps， they get
    you to sign。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: something and we don't have a robot that can do any of that stuff， right？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The other thing to remember here is that management decisions matter enormously
    with IT broadly。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: defined and the introduction of data science tools。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So let's turn back the clock a little bit to the introduction of numerically
    controlled。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: machines and the use of computers in engineering decisions。 We had machine，
    machinists and machines。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Some of that work could be taken over by CNC machines， right？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They have to be programmed and what we saw 20 years ago when they were first
    being introduced。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: is that employers made decisions。 Are we going to hire engineers to program
    these machines or are we going to teach the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: machinists who already do this kind of work how to program the machines， okay？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you teach the machinists how to program machines you don't lose nearly as
    many machinists， jobs。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you hire engineers to do the programming then you're losing all the machinists
    jobs。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and you're hiring in and creating more machinists jobs。 That outcome is a management
    decision。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: right？ So what are the things we've known about the impact of IT on jobs and
    on productivity？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The big impact comes when managers use the IT to restructure how work is organized，
    right？
