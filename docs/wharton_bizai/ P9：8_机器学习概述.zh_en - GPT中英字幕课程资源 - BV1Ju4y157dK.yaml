    As I mentioned。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    and the outputs。
  prefs: []

    For example。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: data， which have a correct answer， meaning that certain data have been labeled
    as spam。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and certain other data has been labeled as not being spam。 And now we need to
    learn how to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: classify future emails。 Similarly， you might have a desire to predict sales
    next week based on。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: historical data。 And we might use data on the season， the month of the year，
    the weather， and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: other such patterns to predict future sales。 And our training data is actually
    past data， which has。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: all these patterns， month， season， weather， and also the actual sales that were
    realized in the past。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And now we're trying to make predictions in the future based on that。 Let's
    look at another example。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of supervised learning。 In a recent research study。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: my colleagues and I were interested in analyzing， social media posts posted
    by a number of companies on Facebook。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So we gathered data on over 100，000 posts， submitted by large brands on Facebook。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And we wanted to identify what kinds of posts are， associated with the highest
    engagement。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that is our emotional posts associated with greater。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: engagement or humorous posts or posts that show deals and promotions to consumers
    or other kinds。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of posts。 Now it is very expensive to tag 100，000 posts and label each post
    as being humorous or not。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: emotional or not， or as offering a price discount or not， and so on。 So we wanted
    to automate this。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: process。 So we use a supervised machine learning technique to do that。 To do
    that， we first need。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: data， a training data set that has clearly labeled inputs and outputs。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The inputs are available to us。 These are the words the companies use in their
    posts。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The output is essentially a label that says， whether the post is emotional or
    humorous or not。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so to do that， we took a sample of 5，000 posts， and had human beings label
    each of these posts。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Every one of these 5，000 posts was labeled by a。

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: human being as being humorous or emotional or as offering a price discount or
    being a post that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: shares a remarkable fact and so on。 These labels were then used as a training
    data set for a。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: supervised machine learning algorithm that learned what kinds of words are predictive
    of whether a。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: post is emotional or humorous or not。 And then that algorithm was used to make
    predictions for。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the remaining nearly 100，000 posts that hadn't been labeled by a human being。
    This is essentially。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the idea of supervised machine learning， which is you need a training data set
    and you learn from that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and you apply that to future data。 And what we found in our study was that our
    machine learning。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: algorithm did well and often had accuracy of over 90， 95 percent and sometimes
    even greater than 99。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: percent in essentially being able to predict whether a post is humorous or whether
    a post is。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: emotional or not。 And in any business application， if you have good high quality
    training data set。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: one can apply these techniques in order to make predictions about the future。
    The key is collecting。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: high quality data。 And that is the most important activity in supervised machine
    learning。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are。

- en: '![](img/02c421482ce67aea3031900e6e9478d5_22.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: a number of very good high quality off the shelf algorithms that can be applied
    to make predictions。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: if you've got high quality training data set for machine learning。 The next
    set of machine learning。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: techniques are unsupervised learning techniques。 Unsupervised learning techniques
    also take in data。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but they don't have clearly labeled output。 So for example， clustering algorithms
    that we。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: discussed previously， they tend to cluster our data into different groups， but
    they're not told。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in advance to what the ideal clustering looks like， meaning there is no labeled
    output for them。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/02c421482ce67aea3031900e6e9478d5_24.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: Similarly， another example is anomaly detection。 Anomaly detection algorithms
    look at a bunch of。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: data and identify data points that look dissimilar to most of the other data。
    Here again， there's a。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: lot of input data， but there's no clearly labeled output。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another example is latent Dirichlet allocation， or LDA。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: which is a commonly used technique for topic modeling， meaning identifying what
    kinds of。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: topics a certain document might cover。 Typically， with LDA， you have an input
    data set which。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: consists of a large set of documents。 The idea behind LDA is that each document
    likely covers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a small set of topics， and each topic itself tends to use the same set of words
    quite frequently。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So for example， we might take a large data set of new stories published in all
    of the major。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: newspapers and online news media outlets and feed that as an input to an LDA
    algorithm。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And LDA is trying to identify the topics that these documents cover， but is
    not given。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: clearly labeled outputs， meaning that the algorithm is not told that here's
    a document on politics and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: here's a document on sports and so on。 LDA， as I said， assumes that each document
    covers very few。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: topics and each topic has a few words that it uses frequently。 And when it takes
    a training。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: data set or an input data set rather， LDA might identify that a certain topic
    tends to use certain。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: words quite frequently。 For example， it might say that here's a topic that tends
    to use the word。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Obama， the word Trump， the word speech， and a few other such words quite frequently，
    but it does。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: not tend to use words like pizza or baseball as frequently。 This clearly， we
    can infer is the topic。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of politics， and that's something that the algorithm identifies on its own。
    Now， given any document。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: LDA then looks at the kinds of words that are used in this document and identifies
    which topics。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it covers。 So given a document， LDA might say that a topic covers sports or
    a topic covers politics。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and so on。 Once LDA has been trained using a large data set。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it can now be applied to any new document。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/02c421482ce67aea3031900e6e9478d5_26.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: and it can automatically classify these documents and identify the topics in
    there。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So in this example， you see a passage that LDA might analyze and it looks at
    certain words that are used in this document。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And with each of these words， it identifies certain topics that these words
    are related to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example， arts or education or children and then it identifies a set of topics
    that this document。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: covers。 Now in addition to unsupervised learning， we also have this idea of
    reinforcement learning。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Reins enforcement learning usually does not take in large training datasets。
    Rather。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the algorithm learns by testing or trying various actions or strategies and
    observing what happens。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and using those observations to learn something。 This is a very powerful method
    and has been used。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in a number of robotics based applications。 It is also at the heart of a software
    created by。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Google which was called Alpha Zero which was an advanced version of Google's
    Go Playing Software。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Alpha Go。 Alpha Go had used training dataset which was based on past Go games
    and Alpha Zero had no。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: training dataset。 Instead， it learned the game of Go by playing Go against itself
    and once it played。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: millions of games against itself， that was in fact the training dataset that
    it used to develop。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the best strategies for this game。 Of course， in many settings， experimentation
    isn't always free。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and so you have to balance the cost of experimentation against exploiting the
    knowledge that we already。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: have。 Let's explore that through a reinforcement learning algorithm known as
    multi-armed bandit。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    two different。

    We do not know。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: which ad copy is more effective in engaging customers and attracting them to
    click on the ad。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We would like to ideally figure out which ad is the better ad to use。 One way
    to figure this out。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: is to do what is known as A/B testing。 That is， we might show ad A to half the
    users and ad B to half。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the users and we might do this for some period of time， let's say a day。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: then we observe which ad has， the higher click through rate and we might use
    that ad there on。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this graph that you see on this， slide we have two ads， ad A and ad B。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Ad A has a click through rate of 5% and ad B has a click through。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: rate of 10% but we do not know this in advance。 So what we might end up doing
    is show ad A to some。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: users and show ad B to some users。 If we have shown these ads in a randomized
    fashion to a large。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: number of users， over time we learned that ad A has 5% click through rate。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: ad B has 10% click through， rate and then we can use ad B from that point onwards。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But there is a cost of this learning because， some people were shown ad A and
    some people were shown ad B during this learning step。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    than we would。

    like any A/B testing。

    to observe what is。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    better than ad A。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and as it learns this it starts to show ad B more frequently than ad A。 It still
    will show ad A。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a few times so it still allows itself to learn and correct itself in case ad
    A actually will。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: perform better。 But over time it starts to weigh ad B more and more and as a
    result if you observe at。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    which used a banded。
  prefs: []

    was much higher than 7。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 5%， that we obtained through A/B testing it was not quite equal to the 10% that
    ad B has but it's close。
