  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As text becomes a more and more valuable form of unstructured data。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/25a79009f9ae76f6de8077dab853d276_1.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: there's been more and more attention paid to natural language processing。 So
    text can provide。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of course， valuable signals about markets and about business decisions。 So for
    example。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: online reviews can tell us a lot about a product。 They can tell us a lot about
    customers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Chatters can tell us online chatter， discussion can tell us a little bit about
    financial market activity。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So lots of applications of how unstructured text can tell us something of predictive
    value for business。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So text can be used to make predictions， but we first have to convert text into
    features。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We have to look at the text and figure out what's important about the text to
    make predictions or to make decisions。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So lots of candidates when we think about converting text into different features。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This includes sentiment， spelling， number of words used in the text。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So how we do this is we first take the text and pre-process it to prepare it
    for analysis。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There's a number of things we can do here in terms of just correcting issues
    with， say。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: white space or extra spaces or moving punctuation and so on。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And then we basically take the text and identify what it is about the text that
    might be important。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: for making predictions in the future。 So the simplest example of a feature in
    text is just a word。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/25a79009f9ae76f6de8077dab853d276_3.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: So for instance， we might look at which words appear in different text and use
    that to predict outcomes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So for an example， like an online review， we might look at particular words
    that have meaning。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: for making predictions about anything from product sales to repeat purchases。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to whether or not a review is deemed helpful or not。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is up to us to choose what those words might be， how they're presented。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It could be sentimental words， positive， negative words。 It could be words about
    the product。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If it's a camera， for instance， it might be something about storage or it might
    be something。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: about the type of format it uses。 Lots of words that we can trigger or unidentify
    that we can use to make a prediction based。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: on the language in the text。 Instead of single words。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we can also branch out a little bit and use more complex features。 We can use
    combinations of words。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We can use groups of words like two to three words grouped together。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We can also construct overall measures of things like sentiment。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So sentiment analysis is one of the most common examples of extracting or creating
    a feature。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: from text。 This is basically describing whether the word somebody uses in a
    piece of text， anything。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: again from an online review to a tweet to a Facebook post。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is sentiment analysis is going to say something about whether the language
    used。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in one of those pieces of text means that somebody is feeling more positive
    about what。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they're talking about or more negative about what they're talking about。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are other ways to map sentiment in a way that can map to larger sets of
    emotions。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: not just positive and negative， maybe fear， maybe anger， things of that nature。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/25a79009f9ae76f6de8077dab853d276_5.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: We have these features and we take the text and we have these features like
    sentiment。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: like what types of words were used。 We could also say think about the length
    of an online review as a feature。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We could think about the spelling or the quality of the grammar used in a online
    review。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: These features once they're extracted from the text then allow us to predict
    outcomes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Sentiment for instance could predict buying behavior。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And then that's one way in which natural language or language is going to be
    used in a machine。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: learning algorithm。 So we take the language， we create the features and then
    we use that for prediction。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now deep learning gives us even more flexibility because it can start to combine
    the text content。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in richer ways or more meaningful ways than we might be limited to when hand
    coding these。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: different features。 So deep learning gives us even more flexibility but conceptually
    it works in much the same way。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So some examples。 Let's talk about examples like news articles or breaking news
    and stock price movements。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So what you might do to think about taking or creating an algorithm that starts
    with breaking。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: news and generates information or predictions about stock price。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So imagine we have a database of news articles or breaking news。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We can then generate features from the news articles。 Things like sentiments。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: things like words that are appearing in the news perhaps names， that are appearing
    in the news。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: names of countries or political leaders。 The label to be predicted is maybe
    the stock movement for a given time unit。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So to make this more precise maybe we're looking at news articles for a particular
    firm or organization。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We have breaking news。 We're going to think about the news that's covering that
    firm。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You're going to start to generate features that indicate positivity toward the
    firm or。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: maybe something about a new product release innovation or patent。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And then the label to be predicted is the stock movement for that firm for a
    given time， unit。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So we have this training data now。 We have a lot of data on features extracted
    from the language from the news covering that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: firm。 And we have the training labels which is what the stock was doing for
    that firm as that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: news was breaking。 We can use that to train the model。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The model is then going to learn how the language used to refer to that firm
    in the news might。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: be affecting or at least predicting how stock price is moving。 We'll use that
    with training data。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We'll set aside some test data to make sure that the model is performing accurately
    once。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we have the model set up in a way that is working well in the test data set。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We can then deploy that as a prediction model using breaking news to predict
    what a firm。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/25a79009f9ae76f6de8077dab853d276_7.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: stock price is going to do。 So that's one type of application using text。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: using natural language processing to make， predictions。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another common application for natural language processing instead of prediction
    is taking。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: text or taking language and putting that into groups or topics。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is an example of what's called unsupervised learning。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We're not trying to predict a label or a class or category。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We're basically trying to take large bodies of text and put them into different
    groups， or topics。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So topic modeling is a term used to refer to one approach which takes documents
    and classifies。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: them by content in a way that makes them easier to interpret。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So if you had a large database of text messages or emails that were just about
    different topics。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you could think about using topic modeling to take maybe a million messages
    and putting。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: them into five or ten categories or topics that can then be used to better understand
    how。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to make decisions based on those topics。 So the topic model will basically tell
    you about how these documents should be grouped。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: together in a way that makes it easier to take action on them from a business
    perspective。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/25a79009f9ae76f6de8077dab853d276_9.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: So an example of this approach， going back to our news example is imagine we
    have lots。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and lots of incoming breaking news on all types of topics， articles from all
    different， agencies。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We want to take these thousands and thousands of news articles that are coming
    in each day。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and classify them into areas like business， tech， science or entertainment。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This kind of classification obviously makes it much easier for consumers to
    navigate and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: find topics or articles that are of interest to them。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so this is an example of topic modeling or unsupervised learning， taking
    large amounts。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of unstructured data and using natural language processing to put these unstructured
    data into。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a smaller number of topics that we can act upon in a more convenient way from
    a consumer。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: perspective or from a business decision perspective。 [BLANK_AUDIO]。
  prefs: []
