- en: of artificial intelligence on the management of people and the related issues
    there。 My。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: name is Peter Capelli。 I've been a professor here at the Wharton School for
    35 years。 I。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: run our Center for Human Resources， among other things。 And I've been setting
    the workplace。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: for a very long time。 And most recently， I've been looking at changes in how
    people are。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: paid and changes in how performance is managed and more generally about the
    move we've been。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: seeing over the last generation toward more open labor markets and movements
    across employees。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And my colleagues and I on this program have been looking at the role that artificial
    intelligence。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: is playing in managing people。 Matthew Bidwell， you'll hear from shortly a colleague
    here。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: who's created the people analytics courses here at the Wharton School and colleague，
    Sonny Tambi。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: who is a reformed computer scientist， I guess we could say， who studies workplace。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: issues and particularly how various kinds of electronic markets affect issues
    like hiring。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So we're going to spend the next four hours or so with you， depending when you
    watch this。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: talking about those issues。 So let me begin with the general point about managing
    people。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are some people probably watching this who have not had a lot of experience
    managing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: people before， particularly if you're coming at this from the data science or
    artificial。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: intelligence side。 And managing people is a huge task。 If we look at the costs
    involved。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in a typical organization， for example， two thirds of all the costs come from
    employees。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: or labor various kinds。 If you look just in the United States， every year we
    hire 66 million。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: people every year。 And that's out of a workforce of 160 million。 So you get
    a sense that some。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of those people are going out one door and into another。 It's another issue。
    Along the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: way we have to talk about how to manage people's performance because the big
    question is how。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: do we get people to do what we want them to do， what we need them to do。 We
    have to think。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: about how we pay them， the careers through which they move and how we help them
    move all。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: those kinds of issues。 To get a sense of how big this is， if you look just at
    the industry。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that has been formed by people pushing work out， outsourcing， managing people
    issues， payroll。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and performance issues but also staffing and hiring issues。 If you total up
    the size of。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that industry， it's half a trillion dollars just in the United States。 So that's
    almost。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the size now of the entire U。S。 construction industry。 So this is a big， big
    issue and one。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: with real money consequences for organizations and for societies。 Particularly
    for businesses。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: one of the things they care about is how the company's brand is affected by
    people management。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: issues。 We're seeing a lot of concern now about sexual harassment， diversity
    and inclusion。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: issues is how they affect the company's financial performance。 Lots of companies
    now are asked。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to demonstrate their compliance with various diversity inclusion policies and
    anti-harassment。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: policies。 When we think about how companies compete， the key issue in business
    strategy。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: at least it seems to me， has been this question of competencies and that is
    how does a business。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: get good at something in a way that allows them to compete and succeed against
    competitors。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: around them。 And almost all that conversation now comes down to questions of
    people and the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: way we manage them because that's about all that differs， frankly， across companies。
    And， of course。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: ultimately， a reason for concern about all these topics is that managing people。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: affects their lives。 Managing people badly causes a range of health problems，
    stress-related。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: problems in particular， and frankly just makes people miserable。 And if we can
    manage people， well。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we can make their lives a whole lot better。 So that， just by itself， is something。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: worth taking very seriously。 So let's talk just a little about what the issues
    are we're。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: going to talk about here over the course of the next few hours with you。 And
    we begin。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: with this issue of what is artificial intelligence。 So let's see if we can talk
    about that for。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: just a minute。 It's a moving target， artificial intelligence。 And the idea behind
    it is those。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: kinds of decisions that kind of intelligence， which can only be made by people，
    by humans。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And the problem is that it is a moving target because we get better with computer
    science。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and decision making， et cetera。 We discover that we can do more and more decision
    making。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: with those。 So what we have at the moment though， when people are talking about
    artificial intelligence。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: is mainly data science。 And what data science is about is an engineering approach
    to data。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So this is the equivalent， you might say， of as engineering is to science， data
    science。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: is to statistics。 So statistics is the underlying discipline on which data science
    is based。 Now。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: data science is particularly applying statistics and related data analysis tools
    to questions。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of optimization。 So what do we mean by that？ The examples would be thinking
    about supply， chains。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: thinking about how we make sure we get just the right amount of stuff to our
    stores。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: at just the right amount of time。 You can think about something like optimal
    scheduling with。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: truck fleets， for example， to make sure that we know we have just the right
    number of truck。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: fleets at just the right time。 The problem when we think about people though
    is that unlike。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: maybe trucks， people get sick， people also get angry and they act out when they're
    angry。 They quit。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If they're not engaged in their work， they don't care about it。 They can slow，
    things down。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They can actually sabotage。 It was an old technique in the union world called，
    work to rule。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And that was if you were really annoyed with the management， what you do is。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: just take the work rules right out of the manual and follow them word for word。
    And you could。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: basically just bring the organization to a stop。 So there are a lot of consequences
    about。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: how you manage people and a lot of implications which are quite different than
    the optimization。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: norms of data science which came out of things like studying machines and studying
    equipment。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The fundamental debate in management over the last century or so or since the
    beginning。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of management， something we'll talk about a little later in the program is about
    the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: divide between management views， leadership views that think about people as
    rational。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: actors and think about managing people along those equivalent lines。 Versus
    a movement。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that began in the 1930s but didn't hit its stride until the 1950s informed more
    by psychology。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: thinking about how people actually respond。 And sometimes people call these
    theory X Douglas。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: McGregor's famous distinction here。 Theory X was people are rational。 That means
    really。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they don't really want to work unless you pay them and if you don't check they
    won't， work hard etc。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And theory Y which says if you manage them correctly they might actually。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: do what you want them to do。 So the way to test where you think you are on this
    distinction。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: is to think is it better to tell your employees what to do or ask them what
    to do。 It's kind。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of two extreme views right。 And the former is kind of a theory X view and the
    latter。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: is kind of a theory Y view。 The theory X view aligns itself with engineering
    principles。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: as we'll see a little later。 And data science and the management of data that
    goes with。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it is based on techniques like machine learning。 You apply those two equipment
    for example。 What。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: are they trying to do？ We're trying to figure out when the ball bearings might
    fail on this。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: very expensive piece of equipment。 Now how do we want to do that？ Well we might
    say we。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: don't particularly care as long as you can predict it。 We'll just listen maybe
    put microphones。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: on there or look for filings in the oil or you know whatever it might be as
    long as it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: predicts when the bearings are going to fail we don't care how it's done。 That's
    all we， care about。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That's good enough。 Once you move to employees and if you ask the question like。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: well when are these employees going to quit？ And you did things like listen
    in to their。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: telephone calls for example or go to their social media and check in。 I think
    the difference。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: there is that we care how you get that answer。 The answer is not simply a good
    prediction on。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: when people are going to quit。 People get very irritated if you have a good
    explanation we。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: can predict with 100% who's going to quit。 If it turns out we did that based
    on listening。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to your phone records。 And so one of the things of course it's most different
    about managing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: people is that these issues like fairness matter a lot and fairness questions
    get embodied in。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the law for example in government regulations of all aspects of employment。
    And so when we。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: start making employment issues and decisions we start bumping up against these
    fairness。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: questions and in practice that means we're bumping up against the law a lot。
    And you don't。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: see that in other aspects of data science。 So one of the big issues related
    to managing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/75d4f837bded482e5bf592c7fcfdf6d2_3.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: people when we confront data science with that is the problem of change management。
    It's。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a general capability that is really important in management。 Change management
    basically。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: means we have organizations that have been doing things one way we want them
    to change。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So before data science came along we had a very intricate and you might say
    very messy。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: system for managing employees。 And if you don't think so go to your human resource
    department。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and ask to see the documents and manuals that are there that describe how employees。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: are supposed to be managed。 And you'll see it's all electronic now but you'll
    see lots。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and lots of files and hundreds of pages explaining how we should manage people。
    We've invested。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a lot of time in training people as to how to manage employees。 And so if with
    data science。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we come into with a very different approach as to how to make decisions on something
    like。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: hiring we confront this problem of change。 We got this complicated system in
    which people。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: are deeply invested already and we're asking them to do it differently now。
    And so that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: is going to be a big question we also have to think about a little bit。 Even
    when we have。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/75d4f837bded482e5bf592c7fcfdf6d2_5.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: data science tools which are really good and they do what we want them to do
    how do we。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: get people to adopt them。 And that's partly a story about how do we get them
    to give up。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: some of the decision making that they currently are exercising to turn it over
    to these algorithms。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So a simple way to think about this is if you're applying data science to something
    like。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: allocating the hotel rooms let's think about optimal pricing to make sure that
    we keep our。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: rooms 100% occupancy or as close as we can get。 The hotel room is not going
    to sue you。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: if you make a mistake with that。 But if you are allocating employees across
    work tasks。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and jobs for example and it turns out that those allocations have some implications
    for。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: fairness it's quite possible the employees might end up suing you。 The same
    algorithms。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in different contexts lead to really really different outcomes。 So one of the
    things we。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: have to think about is the resistance from not just the human resource community
    but。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: line managers who are currently doing things in a quite different way。 So there
    are good。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: reasons for thinking about trying to do a better job carefully with managing
    this process。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of change。 So let's think just a little bit about the opportunity here。 And
    I think in。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: my lifetime looking back at the things that I have seen coming along that changed
    business。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and changed the managing of people。 This could be one of the very biggest ones
    because。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: its potential is the knock-on effects that we change the way we make decisions
    by imposing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: data science tools on it that changes the way we collect data that changes the
    allocation。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of decision rights across people that impacts some of these fairness questions
    all that kind。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of stuff。 The good news is that there is a big opportunity here in introducing
    data science。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and the reason is because a lot of these decisions we are talking about we just
    don't do very。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: well right now。 And as I'm sure you know on questions like hiring there is a
    lot of concern。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that not only are we not doing a great job getting the right people into the
    right jobs。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and finding good employees but that there is a lot of bias involved and a lot
    of discrimination。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in these outcomes。 So there is a lot of room to get better。 It is not like we
    are tweaking。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a model which is running really really well。 And if we get better this makes
    people's lives。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/75d4f837bded482e5bf592c7fcfdf6d2_7.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: better as well。 So that's where we are with this。 It is a real opportunity to
    get better。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It is a real challenge to think about how to apply these tools which were developed
    for。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a very different context in things like manufacturing and applying them to people。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So as I said earlier， I'm going to be here with you throughout this program
    at different points。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: My colleague， Matthew Biddlebel will be here as well for a while and our colleague
    Sonny Tamby will be。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: as well。 You will see us in and out over the course of this program。 And we
    look forward。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to seeing you all the way through to the end。 [ Silence ]。
