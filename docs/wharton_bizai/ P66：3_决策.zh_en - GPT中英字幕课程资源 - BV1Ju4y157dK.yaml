  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that stands for Operations， Information， and Decisions。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: My personal area of interest is the economics of technology and labor。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And one of the areas that includes is how AI is being used in HR systems and
    in hiring。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In that process， I've worked with a number of companies that serve as labor
    market intermediaries。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and that are at the forefront of thinking about how algorithms are used in the
    HR process。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I've enjoyed working with a number of data science teams as well that wrestle
    with questions。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: around HR data and what it can help us predict。 When thinking about how data
    science。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: how AI are used and going to be used in HR， it's， useful to think about machine
    learning as a way to take data and to algorithmically arrive。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: at what you might call a prediction。 Now， when I say prediction， in the HR context。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: this also corresponds to just saying a recommendation。 So for instance。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: should we invite a candidate for an interview or not？ As you know。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it's becoming cheaper than ever to apply to jobs and so HR screeners are often。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: inundated with applications and so machine learning tools are becoming very
    valuable for。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: recommending or predicting whether a candidate would be a good interview candidate。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You could also think about a prediction or recommendation in the sense of promoting
    an， employee。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You shouldn't be promoted or not。 Should a particular benefit be recommended
    or not to an employee？

- en: '![](img/99cede32118ee82da76132341daa4039_3.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: So the goal is always going to be to use the data to make a prediction of some
    sort。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So we want to be able to eventually is to answer the question what context，
    what decision。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: context are really suitable for machine learning predictions and why？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What makes them suitable and what might some of the trade-offs be when we think
    about using。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: machine learning for these types of applications？ Now， to do so。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it's useful to understand a little bit about how machine learning works。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And I find it's useful to think about as we talk about how machine learning
    works， it's。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: useful to think about a progression from what you might call human decision
    making to machine。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: learning。 So you might think about a progression that moves from human decision
    making to the use。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of rule-based systems。 We'll talk about what that means shortly。 And then machine
    learning， finally。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/99cede32118ee82da76132341daa4039_5.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: So let's talk about talking about how people themselves make decisions。 So when
    we make decisions。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we use our knowledge and experience to develop heuristics。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And this is especially true in environments where information is imperfect。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We're often asked to make rapid decisions。 We don't have all the information
    we need。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: HR is a great example。 Again， HR or screeners or recruiters are seeing more
    and more applications for a given。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: job opening a given listing。 You can never know everything you want to know
    about a candidate。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so we use the experience and the knowledge we've gained in the past， the
    heuristics we've。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: developed over time to decide whether or not a candidate might be a good fit
    for the organization。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One way to think about this type of decision making process is as a tree。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is a common way to think about decisions is as a decision tree。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So there are a number of factors that we might weigh when thinking about whether
    or not a。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: person or we might want to elevate a resume to the top of the staff。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We might be looking at different factors in the person's application。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It might have to do with what school they went to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It might have to do with a prior experience or prior employers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It might have to do with skills or some kind of cultural fit that we're looking
    at in their。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: application。 With these different pieces of information form a tree。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We might say if they went to a particular school in a particular program， we
    know that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they have good training in a particular area which is going to suggest the person
    might。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: be a good fit for the organizational role that you're trying to fill。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So imagine you had a stack of resumes to evaluate and think about the tree that
    you might create。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What factors would it include？ If you think through that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it may depend on various factors that are unique or idiosyncratic。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to your organization or your particular knowledge of the position you are trying
    to fill。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It might depend on specific things at the organization that you're working for
    or looking。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to care about deeply when it looks for new candidates。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So this requires in the role of an HR screener， requires experience related
    to hiring for。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that specific organization。 It relates to maybe prior experience hiring for
    that specific role。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is the way things have been done generally in the past and it's a good
    method but there。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: are drawbacks of this approach。 When we have people who are using their prior
    knowledge。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: prior experience to develop heuristics， to hire people for an organization，
    it's time consuming。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Obviously for the amount of time it takes a person to move through a stack of
    resumes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: like that is very time consuming。 It's also again noisy and imperfect。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Even though the knowledge experience we've gained over time is extremely valuable，
    it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: can't capture the entire state of the world。 It can't capture everything about
    the market of applicants that we're seeing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And of course， applicants change and signals change。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's impossible or very difficult at least to capture all of that and incorporate
    that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: into our decision making。 And then as people， people always have biases。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so these are some of the drawbacks to the approach where people using their
    knowledge。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and experience develop various heuristics to make decisions。

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: In the next video， we'll start to focus on what are called rule-based systems
    which start。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to address at least one of these issues and starts to get at the others as well。
