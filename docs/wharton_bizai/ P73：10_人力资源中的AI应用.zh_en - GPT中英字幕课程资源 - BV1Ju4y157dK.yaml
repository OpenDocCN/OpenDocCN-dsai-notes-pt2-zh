  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: So first of all we've talked about managing people in some kind of unique challenges
    that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it creates and how organizations have tended to address those challenges。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Sony has also introduced you to the magic of machine learning。 These new tools
    and techniques。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: technology enabled and now being used to build much stronger。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: algorithms and better predictions of a wide range of things that we have before。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So now I think we're at a good point to really take those algorithms and apply
    them to the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: problems that we described earlier of managing people。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And think about the different ways in which machine learning can be used to
    improve how。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we manage people。 Now in doing so I think a key point that I want to make。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So these are algorithms that Sony describe。 The general purpose technologies。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: By which I mean they're kind of a set of techniques that we can apply to any
    problem， you know。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: be it issues of pattern recognition， training computers to identify every cat
    on。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the internet solving some of production problems。 You name it。 Okay。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: so when we talk about how to apply this to managing employees what's different
    is。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: going to be a couple of things。 So one is figuring out what kind of data we're
    going to use。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So these algorithms that Sony described what they're really very good at is
    take a bunch。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of input data and an output and just figuring out which of these input data。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So I'll talk for example about predicting nutrition。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What are all of the signals about how people behave that we can use to predict
    who leads。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So one of the key things that's figuring out what kind of data is it that will
    do the best。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: job of predicting who's going to leave。 So often a lot of what we're going to
    think about is what data could we use to make these。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: predictions， the cleverer of the data， the better the outcome。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The other thing that we really want to think about when we apply these is how
    would we。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: actually use these algorithms。 Algorithms just give you predictions。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Predictions on themselves are not useful。 And so what is it that these action
    neighbors do？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What are the actions that come out of it？ So I'm going to talk about how these
    algorithms can be applied in three different areas of managing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: people。 So first off engagement， tracking how motivated our employees are， how
    pleased they are to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: be here。 One one attrition， figuring out who's going to stay， who's going to
    leave and what we can。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: do about it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/6614ee4190166d8ff917d235280a1c4f_3.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: And third building internal career paths within the organization。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is not an exhaustive list of all of the ways that machine learning can
    be used in。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: managing people。 I think it would be hard to build such an exhaustive list。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In particular I would say though， one huge area where we're seeing machine learning
    being。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: used is hiring。 I'm going to ignore that because Peter's going to spend a bunch
    of time talking about。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that。 I'm going to talk about these three engagement， attrition and career paths。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We're going to start with engagement。 Thank you。 [ Silence ]。
