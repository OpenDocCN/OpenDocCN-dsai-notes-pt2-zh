- en: So in this video I want to talk about the data science workflow。 And before
    diving into that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: let me remind you of what we just spoke of， which is the scientific method。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: So that was a four-step process where we begin by clearly articulating a specific
    or precise question。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We then guessed an answer or answers。 That is， we hypothesize the answers to
    that question。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We then identify the empirical implications of those different hypotheses or
    guesses。 That is。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: if those hypotheses or guesses are correct， what should we see in the data？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And then the last step is to compare those implications with what's actually
    in the data。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And in this video I want to focus on that last step because there's an actual
    process for comparing those implications with what we see in the data。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And that process is referred to as the data science workflow。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/f39b9e3737b5e687519f3b46268e63bf_3.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: Now as always， we start by Googling data science workflow and you get， in this
    case。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: over 95 million hits。 Perhaps more interestingly， there's a whole bunch of different
    images describing the data science workflow。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: some quite colorful， as you can see on the screen。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But while there's many different ways to describe this workflow。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: many different labels for the different steps， I'd like to keep things very
    simple and intuitive。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So let me describe the data science workflow in terms of the following four
    steps。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/f39b9e3737b5e687519f3b46268e63bf_5.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: The first step is acquisition and verification。 So first you've got to get the
    data。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You've got to acquire the data。 And that could be a very simple process as easy
    as grabbing a spreadsheet off your local computer。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It could be more involved with getting data from different parts of the organization。
    It could be。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it could involve hooking into external APIs to download data。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It could be scraping data off of the web。 It could be purchasing proprietary
    data from different vendors。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Data is everywhere and there's nearly as many ways to get it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But that in and of itself is a part of the process。 Of course once we have the
    data。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you have to verify it。 Reagan used to say trust but verify。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Never is it more true than when working with data。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So quite often data will come with some sort of data dictionary or documentation。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Never take that at face value。 We always want to verify the data by actually
    looking at it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: by beginning to work with it and making sure we understand it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now having acquired and verified the data that it is what we think it is。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the second step is to prepare the data for analysis。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And that might sound like a straightforward step。 But as I'll mention in just
    a minute， it is not。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Quite often data is in a variety of formats。 We're going to have to wrangle
    that data。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We're going to have to clean that data。 We're going to have to explore that
    data through exploratory data analysis。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: perhaps EDA。 To again improve our understanding to further verify。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: maybe we'll have to go back to step one to get more data or different data。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But preparation is in and of itself an important step in the data science workflow。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Once we've prepared our data， again ensuring that we understand it， that it's
    correct。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that it's in a format that's ready for whatever analysis we intend to take。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We then analyze the data and analyzing the data can be as simple as producing
    an average or standard deviation。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: some summary statistic， or can be as complex as running a machine learning or
    AI pipeline in which we explore。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We train and test a variety of different models to arrive at a final model that
    will put into production。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The last step of the data science workflow that's sort of alluded to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but not often considered a formal step is what I call communication。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So having gone through the process of acquiring， preparing， and analyzing the
    data。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: arguably the most important part， or at least an equally important part。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: is being able to communicate your results to decision makers in a manner that
    is clear and compelling so that they can take action。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And it's quite often there's a disconnect between steps one through three and
    step four that I think is a disservice to data analytics in the workplace that
    sort of puts a ceiling on just how powerful and how useful data analytics can
    be。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: because data scientists or whomever's working with the data is simply。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: able to communicate their findings in a way that resonates with management who
    may not be as well versed as working with data as data scientists。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: statisticians and others may be。 So those are the four steps of the data science
    workflow and I put a little very lowbrow pie chart on the slide to illustrate
    what I think is sort of a general breakdown of time and effort in the data science
    workflow。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so the numbers in the pie chart correspond to the numbers or the steps in
    the data science workflow。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and you'll see that too preparation is the majority of the pie。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And that's certainly been my experience。 It's been the experience of virtually
    all of my colleagues。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: preparing， cleaning， understanding the data takes so much time。 In my experience。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a good 75 80% of the time at least， whereas， you know。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the actual analysis once it's once the data is in a nice clean format is relatively
    straightforward。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's relatively easy to push data through models。 It's a whole different thing
    to have the confidence in the data that's being pushed into the model。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so you can see that just the preparation takes a lot of time。 And so don't
    underestimate that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Of course， there's always exceptions。 This isn't a rule。 It's just a general
    characterization。
