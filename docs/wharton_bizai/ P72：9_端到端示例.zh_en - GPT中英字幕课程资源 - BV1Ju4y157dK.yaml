- en: Let's talk about some of the concepts that we've mentioned related to machine
    learning。

- en: related training data， and how it fits together in an overall workflow。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So let's talk about the example we've been working with which is applicant screening。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So imagine we want to build a system to automate the process of going from。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: candidate applications to an interview。 So how does that total workflow look？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So the first thing we're going to do is to gather historical data on prior，
    decisions。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: prior good decisions。 So we want to make sure that we're choosing decisions
    made by people that we。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: know have have a lot of expertise in this particular area。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So we'll gather historical data on good decisions。 And again。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we don't at this point need to know anything about HR or the organization。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: as long as the data are drawn from the specific business context that we are
    examining。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And this is why machine learning is so transformative and so powerful。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So the first step is to gather historical data on prior good decisions from
    some， source。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It can be archival data。 It can be something you generate explicitly for this
    task。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And this might include in this case resume data test scores。 Increasingly these
    days。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it's including video data that you collect during， interviews， audio transcripts
    from interviews。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and other nonconventional。

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: sources of data that get produced or generated。 Now， as long as we have strong
    labels。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: meaning as long as we have strong， examples of how data like this would be mapped
    by an expert to a final decision。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we don't really need to know about how any of these data actually matter for。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: thinking about candidate performance that will get automatically mapped by。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the machine learning algorithm。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/4966feb57bc6133397c8986e6b5a1808_5.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: We don't， for example， need to know or have a prior sense of how audio。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: transcripts might relate to candidate quality。 Machine learning will learn that
    on its own。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And again， with modern machine learning， the more data the better， so the bigger
    these data sets。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the more access to data we have， the better and better these machine learning
    tools will perform。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/4966feb57bc6133397c8986e6b5a1808_7.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: So we'll start with the data。 I can access to data。 Then we're going to specify
    a model。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: decide what it is。 We're trying to optimize what the errors are that we care
    about。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And we're going to then run and optimize the model to perform well。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: not only on the data that we're using， training data that we're using to build
    the model。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we're also going to make sure that it works well on a， we call a hold out sample
    or test data。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So what we want to do in this process is build the model using these training
    examples。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and then test the performance of the model on some other sample of data。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: just to make sure that it works well on a sample of data that we， don't。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: haven't used to actually build the model itself。 And so this process is also
    an important part of the machine learning engineering process。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: just to make sure that it robustly performs on data seen in the real world。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: not just data used to train the model。 After we're happy with the performance
    thereafter。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we've gone through these tests and checks to make sure that it performs as well
    as it can。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: on the types of errors we care about， we're at that point ready to deploy。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So you can now start to run predictions on input data for candidates where we
    don't know the answer。
  prefs: []

- en: '![](img/4966feb57bc6133397c8986e6b5a1808_9.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: So again， we just start with the historical data that we know to be good data。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We use these data to train the machine learning algorithm。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We make sure it performs well on out of sample data and we're happy with that
    performance。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We can then deploy the algorithm in the real world。
