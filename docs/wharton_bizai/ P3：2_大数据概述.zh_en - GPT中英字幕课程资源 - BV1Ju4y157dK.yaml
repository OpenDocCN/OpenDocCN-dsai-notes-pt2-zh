- en: In particular， we will start with an overview of what exactly is big data。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We'll talk a little bit about what kinds of skills are needed to excel with
    big data。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We'll talk about big data tools and infrastructure。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And we will conclude by talking about data mining and setting up the stage。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: To begin with， let's explore what exactly is big data。 Now。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: data is certainly a concept that's been around for a really long time。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And there has been an emphasis on data for several decades now。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We hear phrases like "data is the new oil。"， "Data is just like crude。 It's
    valuable。"。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But if undefined， it cannot really be used。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: Futurist John Naysbait says that we have for the first time an economy。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: which is based on a key resource that is information that is not only renewable。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but it's also self-generating。 Running out of this resource is not the problem。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but drowning in it is the real problem。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/4714e22e658d1ca84b3d59f841777356_7.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: Now， we've heard phrases like this for a while。 A data has been very important
    to businesses for multiple decades。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But the focus or emphasis on big data is relatively new。 Now， big data， as the
    term suggests。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: is about large volume of data。 In fact， the National Institute of Standards
    and Technology says that big data。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: exceeds the capacity or capability of conventional methods and computer systems。
    Now。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: volume is certainly a key aspect of big data， but it's not just about volume。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/4714e22e658d1ca84b3d59f841777356_9.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: When we talk about big data， we're talking about data with different structure。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We're talking about data that is being created at a different speed。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We're talking about different kinds of tools to analyze the data。 And most importantly。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: from a managerial standpoint， we're talking about different kinds of business。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/4714e22e658d1ca84b3d59f841777356_11.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: questions that we can answer with that。 Now， one way to think about big data
    is through the three V's of big data。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: volume， variety and velocity。 Volume of data simply implies that we're not talking
    about terabytes or petabytes of data。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In short， the kinds of data that won't fit in our laptops and personal computers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The kind of data that we cannot open in Excel and just start analyzing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That's what the volume of data is all about。 In terms of variety。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we refer to the fact that we're no longer talking about structured。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: numerical data that you can analyze in Excel spreadsheets。 We're talking about
    unstructured data。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: meaning text data， audio data， video data， where there's intelligence hidden
    in that data that we want to extract。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In terms of velocity， we're referring to the idea that data are constantly coming
    in。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's streaming every second and milliseconds。 And we need to be able to perhaps
    even analyze the data and make decisions on the fly。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That's what data velocity is all about。 Sometimes when we talk about big data，
    there's a fourth V。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: which is veracity or truthfulness of data that comes in。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/4714e22e658d1ca84b3d59f841777356_13.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: Data veracity refers to the point that data are coming in from multiple sources。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and are not curated as in the past。 And so you might have data coming in from
    social media platforms。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: meaning user-generated content， and this content might not exactly be high quality
    data。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So we need to account for that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/4714e22e658d1ca84b3d59f841777356_15.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: We might also have inconsistency of data or incomplete data。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/4714e22e658d1ca84b3d59f841777356_17.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: And so data veracity is also becoming a fourth issue。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: which is very critical and an integral part of big data。 Now， of course。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a natural question to ask is， why is this emphasis on big data so new？ And really。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it comes down to two things。 The first is computing capacity。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Computing capacity has been growing exponentially。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Our ability to store data and process data has been growing exponentially。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And that has made big data tools available today that simply weren't available
    ten years back。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The second is data generation itself is being transformed。 In the past。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: data was generated in a centralized way。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/4714e22e658d1ca84b3d59f841777356_19.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: And it was limited。 In contrast， today data is being generated in a decentralized
    way。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There's a lot of user-generated content that our customers， for example， are
    generating。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There is data generated from mobile devices， again from each individual user。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There's data being generated from thousands of sensors that a company might
    be using in its manufacturing facility or retail stores。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: All of these factors are resulting in an explosion of data and really is all
    about the transformation in data。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But most importantly， big data also changes the kinds of things a manager can
    do。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/4714e22e658d1ca84b3d59f841777356_21.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: In particular， big data allows managers to ask new questions that they simply
    couldn't ask before。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And they also help answer the same old questions better。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So in terms of the ability to ask new questions， consider the problem of a marketing
    manager that's trying to design a marketing campaign for a new product。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The manager has to decide what product features to emphasize。 If it's a phone。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the manager has to decide whether we should be talking about the battery life
    of the phone。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Or should we instead be talking about the sleek design of the phone？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Or should we instead talk about the user interface and how user-friendly it
    is？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Or should we talk about the brand as such and be talking about our social and
    philanthropic initiatives in our marketing campaigns？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: These are questions that are hard to answer。 In the past， they were answered
    partly by gut。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: partly by small-scale user service。 But now a marketing manager can look at
    data on social media platforms。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And they can look at data on Twitter and Facebook and other platforms and look
    at what aspects of our products are customers really appreciating and enjoying。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What is it that data on social media platforms that suggests that differentiates
    our brand from other brands？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And they can use these data to precisely craft marketing messages。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This might not have been feasible in the past， but is feasible through big data
    that is available on social media platforms that we can analyze at scale。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I also mentioned that big data allows us to answer the same old questions better。
    For example。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: consider credit card fraud detection。 Credit card fraud is rampant in the financial
    services industry and costs these companies billions of dollars。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the past， it was hard to detect。 And most commonly， it was detected well
    after the fact。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example， a customer might see their credit card statement and conclude that
    a certain transaction is fraudulent and might call the customer service center
    and flag that transaction。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And then it gets corrected。 But it's done after the fact and often it's hard
    to really recover the lost money。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In contrast， today with big data tools， companies can analyze transactions on
    the fly。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Right after a customer swipes a credit card on a terminal。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: big data tools can analyze their transaction and determine whether it's fraudulent
    or not。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This helps not only detect fraud faster。 It also helps do it at a scale which
    simply was not feasible before。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And this is creating a lot of value to financial services companies。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And the value of big data is not limited to just financial services company。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We see applications in a number of industries like healthcare， education。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: transportation and many more。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/4714e22e658d1ca84b3d59f841777356_23.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: For example， if you look at healthcare， there's a big trend in wearable devices
    these days。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A lot of consumers are wearing devices like Fitbit and others。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And these devices are able to capture data about heart rate， sleep patterns。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: exercise and many more aspects of our daily lifestyle。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/4714e22e658d1ca84b3d59f841777356_25.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: This kind of data ultimately helps consumers take better actions to improve
    their well-being。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/4714e22e658d1ca84b3d59f841777356_27.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: Similarly， consider transportation。 There are sensors on roads that can capture
    data on traffic patterns。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: road closures， accidents。 And now that kind of data is being made available
    to us in real time on our mobile devices。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This helps us plan our route better， helps in scheduling and ultimately is the
    basis of applications like Google Maps and many other mapping systems many of
    us use on a daily basis。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: These are part of a few examples of applications of big data。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/4714e22e658d1ca84b3d59f841777356_29.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: And in fact， later in module 3， we will look at a number of other applications
    of big data in a variety of industries。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We will also look at how machine learning is being used in these industries
    to extract intelligence out of the data in these settings。
