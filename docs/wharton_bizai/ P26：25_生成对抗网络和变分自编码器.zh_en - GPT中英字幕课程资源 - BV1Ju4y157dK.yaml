- en: Generative models are becoming increasingly important and more and more widely
    used。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We've been talking about models mostly that essentially discriminate between
    two categories。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They mark something as being true or false or one or zero。 That's called a discriminative
    model。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A generative model does something slightly different。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Instead of classifying data into two categories， a generative model asks the
    question what。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the underlying process is that could have generated the type of data that we're
    seeing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in the sample。 What that means practically is that generative models can create
    new instances of the data。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: once they learn。 Once they understand the process that can generate the data
    that we're observing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it， can then start to use that to create new instances of the data。

    between machine。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: learning and what we think about as traditional areas of human creativity。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There have been many examples of generative models applied to areas like art
    and music。 For example。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: there have been generative models used to generate new songs that are in particular。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: styles like country or jazz。 These generative models produce the instrumentation，
    the lyrics。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: even the vocals they can emulate， as well。 There are generative models that
    are used to produce new styles of arts。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are also generative models that can be used to produce art in styles that
    mimic。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: those of traditional masters。 Van Gogh， for instance。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You can use generative model to basically create art in the style of Van Gogh。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The most famous generative model perhaps is text applications， particularly
    GPT-3， GPT-2。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: which received a lot of press。 These types of generative models can generate
    text in a way that could have been written。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: by a student essay or a journalist。 So with a generative model like GPT-3。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    to fill out。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: several paragraphs that look like they were written by a human。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the press has covered certainly a lot of the interesting demonstrations， of
    GPT-3。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: one can certainly think about business applications。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And many of these are -- there are a number of ventures these days that are
    trying to develop。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: products around this type of technology。 You could think about using technologies
    like this to create full emails or make it easier。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: given a starting point。 Now one variation on this called a generative adversarial
    network is a particularly important。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: application of a generative model。 And this is a type of technology that is
    used to generate artificial content that is increasingly。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: hard to tell apart from real content。 So the way a generative adversarial network
    or again。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: as it's sometimes called， works is， it uses two networks competing with one
    another。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It uses a generative network that creates new content， and then it uses another
    network。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that is basically used simply to tell whether the output of the first network
    is real or， fake。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/eb9c6f5b23b7bec2e5863872891434ab_7.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: So a generator is constantly putting out new artificial content， and the discriminator
    is。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: looking at that content that's putting put out and saying it's real or fake。
    And over time。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that generator will then learn what it needs to do to create content that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: is harder and harder for the discriminator to identify as being fake content。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And through that process， the generator develops more and more content that
    is hard to distinguish。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    have been used to quickly advance our。

    way that a。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: machine or a human has a very difficult time looking at the picture and saying
    whether this。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: is a picture of a human， a human face or something else。 Lots of applications
    around this。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A lot of controversy around these types of applications as well。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So as we think about these technologies， these are where some of the concerns
    around things。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

- en: Another technology that's related to some of this type of generation is variational
    auto。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: encoders or VAEs。 They have a slightly different role and goal。 So encoders
    themselves。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/eb9c6f5b23b7bec2e5863872891434ab_15.png)'

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: be used to recreate itself。 So an auto encoder will take something like an image
    or a song。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: boil it down to a simpler， representation of itself that can then be used to
    recreate itself。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/eb9c6f5b23b7bec2e5863872891434ab_19.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: Now a variational auto encoder is particularly interesting because it can be
    used to slightly。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: vary some attributes or aspects of the image in ways that we might care about。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So we can take an image， we can boil it down into its parts， maybe tweak it
    in some ways。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We can change the hair color for instance and then recreate the image。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is going to allow for something called control generations。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We're not just generating artificial content， but we're generating artificial
    content in。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a way that we can start to control how it's different or how it gets tweaked。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we can use VAEs to alter the faces in particular ways。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
