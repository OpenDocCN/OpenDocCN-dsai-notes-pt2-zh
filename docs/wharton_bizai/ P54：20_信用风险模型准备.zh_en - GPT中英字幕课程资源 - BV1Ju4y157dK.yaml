  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: So let's continue preparing for this modeling process。 And just to be clear，
    let's reset the stage。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: right？ The goal here is in some sense to estimate a function。 F。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: using a bunch of input variables or predictors or explanatory variables that
    will help classify。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: our outcome variable， y is either investment grade or speculative grade。 Right。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: so y is our outcome variable， it's one if investment grade zero otherwise， it
    could。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: be one and minus one， and it doesn't matter。 And all these x's here are our
    model inputs or predictors explanatory variables。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so from the last video， we are starting our sort of starting point for this
    exercise。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: will be all the credit risk KPIs that we discussed at the outset to sort of
    get an economic。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: understanding of， you know， what corporate credit risk is and how we measure
    it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: Now that said， I'm going to take a look at the correlation matrix for all of
    these predictors。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and I've done so in sort of a heat map format。 So let me explain what this colorful
    picture shows。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So each row and each column correspond to a different combination of variables。
    Right。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: so the first row corresponds to the current ratio， the first column， the current，
    ratio， second row。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: quick ratio， second column， quick ratio， and so on and so on and so on。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Each number in the matrix corresponds to the correlation between a pair of variables。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now you'll notice that the diagonal on the diagonal， they're nothing but ones
    because。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: those represent the correlation between a variable with itself。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So the correlation between the current ratio and the current ratio is one as
    is the correlation。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: between the assets to equity ratio and the assets to equity ratio。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The coloring is just there to help identify stronger or weaker correlations。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Stronger correlations are identified and I need to be able to be careful here。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Your positive correlations are identified by darker colors。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Here's the scale one being the strongest。 Stronger negative correlations by
    lighter colors。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We don't have anything perfectly negatively correlated but we do have some correlations。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that are less than negative point four。 Even negative point five as we see the
    debt to asset ratio and interest coverage ratio。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now why am I showing you this？ Well， I label the slide redundancy with a question
    mark because when we first introduced these。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: measures we sort of bucketed them by what they weren't trying to measure。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So that first group of liquidity measures， the current ratio， quick ratio， and
    cash ratio。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they're all trying to get measures of liquidity。 Now not surprisingly。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they're also positively correlated and from just from looking at the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: numbers as well as the darkness of the shading， they are very strongly positively
    correlated。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Likewise we also have some measures that are very strongly negatively correlated。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When we think about the debt to capitalization ratio relative to the interest
    coverage ratio。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: or debt to assets to interest coverage， we've got debt in the numerator and
    debt in the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: denominator。 And so there's a very strong negative correlation there。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The point of this exercise is to suggest the idea that， well， we can throw in
    all of these。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: variables into the model and let it sort of parse through what works and what
    doesn't。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That's not always the best strategy。 There's this notion of model parsimony
    or simplicity that is very important and quite useful when。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it comes to forecasting out of sample。 And so we may want to sort of pare down
    what we look at in terms of the number of variables。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and that's something we'll investigate a little bit later on， but something
    to be aware， of。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Of course， anything that's perfectly correlated is just going to create all
    sorts of problems。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: for the model。 So that's something else we could identify from this correlation
    matrix。 Now。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in the case of thousands of variables， looking at a visualizing that matrix
    is completely。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: infeasible， but we can， of course， comb through it through， you know， programmatically
    or we。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: can use data compression techniques like principal components analysis， something
    a little bit。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/09a88955f3c611834b896a2e110fbafd_5.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: beyond the scope of what we're going to be discussing today。 All right。 Now。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the next thing I want to talk about are train test splits， which should be done
    at。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the very start of this process。 So I'm doing a little bit of a no-no here。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but it sort of eases the flow of the discussion。 What we need to do is we need
    to take that sample of data and split it into pieces。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A training piece on which we'll be training our model， estimating our model，
    trying to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: find the best model， and then a test piece or a holdout sample that we only
    look at once。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we've finalized a model。 See， what we want to avoid doing is overfitting。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We don't want to build a model that can describe the data we have really well，
    because then。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: when new data comes in， it may function very poorly。 The classification accuracy
    may be very poor。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So we really want to train our model on the data that we have， and only once
    we've settled。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: on a model， determine if it's worthwhile on the back end with the test data。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So we're going to train test split our sample。 I'm going to do it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So we've got here's our full data set， 10，540 observations。 My training data
    has 8，432 observations。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: My test data has 2，108 observations。 And what I'm showing you here are the variable
    averages for all of our predictors。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: as well， as the outcome variables。 So investment grade is an indicator equal
    to one when the observation is investment grade。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: zero otherwise。 What I'm showing you here is that the average for each of these
    variables across the full。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: training and test subsamples are very similar。 In fact， if I actually。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: what I'm not showing you here are sort of our test statistics， statistically。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: testing the differences between these numbers， they're all very small。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So they are economically and statistically indistinguishable， which is what
    you should expect。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: if you just randomly allocate observations to training and test。 So let me just
    summarize。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We've done all of our data acquisition verification， our data preparation/model
    preparation。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And what we're ready to transition to now is the actual modeling， which is what's
    coming。
