- en: Companies care a lot about engagement because they think more engaged employees
    are likely。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: to be more motivated and work harder， perform better， and they're more likely
    to stand。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So this has been something companies focus a lot of attention on managing and
    therefore。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: trying to measure。 And so I pointed out kind of the key way organizations have
    done this in the past is。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: using annual surveys。 Are there other approaches that we can take to do this？
    Yes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: this is one of the areas where people are starting to explore using machine
    learning。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: How does that work？ Well， in order to understand how these algorithms work。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I actually think it's quite useful to， think about how we might do it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So suppose you're a manager and you want to assess the engagement of each of
    your subordinates。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: without using a survey。 Basically just figure out in a good mood or in a bad
    mood who's excited。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: How would you do it？ One of the first things you do and the most obvious is
    just listen to them when they're。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: talking。 Are they complaining a lot？ Are they saying that work's exciting and
    they're pleased by it？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Or are they kind of a little bit more withdrawn as most of what they're talking
    about the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: downsides of their work？ Just by tracking that， that's probably the first way
    that you would try and figure out。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: are people engaged。 It turns out that these sorts of things are things that
    machine learning does very well。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so what I want to talk about in terms of tracking engagement is using machine
    learning。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to in a systematic way， work through what employees are saying， talk about two
    approaches。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So one is sentiment analysis and the second is topic modeling。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So let's start with sentiment analysis。 The basic principle of sentiment analysis
    is taking text。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: any text and trying to figure， out the emotional content of that text。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Is it text that talks about people being happy？ Is it text that talks about
    people being sappy？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So again， before thinking about the computer， suppose you needed to train a
    friend to do， this。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Suppose you collected a whole bunch of descriptions of your employees of their
    work where they。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: talk about how they're feeling about it。 And you want your friend to tell you
    how many of them are pleased with their work and how。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: many of the disengages。 Now， suppose also that your friend had literally zero
    emotional intelligence。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: right？ Maybe they're an academic， right？ So they find it hard to do this without
    really explicit instruction。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: How could you get somebody who really doesn't have this emotional intelligence
    to figure， it out？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Well， what you'll probably end up telling them to do is just。 Okay。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: let's look at all of the words in their descriptions that describe emotions。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Some of those words are going to be about positive emotions。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They're going to talk about being happy or excited。 Other words are going to
    be negative。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They're going to talk about being frustrated or disappointed。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so we could just even just count all of these words and then compare their
    frequencies。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: where people are using a lot more happy words。 You know， they were using words
    like， "Please。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: excited， engaged。"， If they're American， probably they'll describe themselves
    as stoked。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If they're using those sorts of words， then we're pretty sure that they're feeling
    engaged。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And this is the basis of sentiment analysis。 So what it does is it starts with
    a predefined dictionary of words。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So it has a long list of all of the words that we associate with positive emotions
    and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: another long list of all of the words that it associates with negative emotions。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so any piece of text， any answer to a question that you want to code in
    this way。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it will just go through， count the number of words， positive emotions。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the number of words with negative emotions and look at the differences between
    them。 Now。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you're probably thinking， there are some really obvious problems with doing
    this。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/9efb988acf98fce0c0a767903c9fbc08_3.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: What if somebody says they're not happy？ How do you code that？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So usually these algorithms are sophisticated enough that， you know， things
    like if there's。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: not before it， either we ignore the word or we reverse its meanings。 Obviously
    that's not perfect。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You can imagine there might be some contorted examples。 You know， if I say I'm
    inadequately excited。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you know， is it going to catch that's a negative， thing or not？ Hard to tell。
    So yeah。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: there's going to be some error there。 We can also imagine there are differences
    in how people express themselves。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You know， if you're British and you say the works fine， you're actually quite
    excited。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you're American and you say the works great， it basically means here。 It's
    okay。 And so kind of。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you know， not only do you see these national differences， but obviously， kind
    of between people。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: there are differences。 Some people are always exuberant and say， you know。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: being able to control for those people， is hard。 And so that's also going to
    lead to inaccuracies。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And then the third thing， just with the surveys， we can imagine people might
    be strategic。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: particularly if they know that we're going to be looking at what they say to
    figure out。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/9efb988acf98fce0c0a767903c9fbc08_5.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: how engaged they are。 The question may be less how engaged at my and more how
    engaged do I want people to think。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I am？ I say， there are definitely problems with this。 I mean， when you look
    at it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: people have tried to validate these kind of analyses， basically。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: use these algorithms to code the sentiment of text and then get human raters
    to do the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: same sort of coding。 Actually， when you do that， you do see quite good correlations
    between what the computer。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: says and what people say。 You know， my sense with this is that ultimately， you
    know， any one piece。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: particularly a fairly， short piece of text， there could be all sorts of errors
    in it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But when you look at large bodies of text， when you look at， you know， what's
    been written。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: across people， generally the accuracy that you get by these methods is really
    pretty good。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And the obvious advantage of it is， yeah， I don't need to read everything and
    make my。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: own judgment about what they're doing。 I can just get these numbers coming straight
    out of the analysis from the computer。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/9efb988acf98fce0c0a767903c9fbc08_7.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: So sentiment analysis is just a tool。 It's a way of coding text for emotions。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The obvious question we want to ask ourselves is if we're planning to use this
    to understand。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: how engaged our people are， what text are we going to use？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It could be anything that they've written， but where are we going to find it？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In thinking about where to use sentiment analysis， I think that there's kind
    of a trade-off。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: between say， comprehensiveness and sense of invasiveness by the employer。 So，
    yeah。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: if I really want to know when people are excited or not， probably the best thing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I could look at is their emails and instant messages， right？ I mean。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: these days within the organization， a huge amount of our communication happens。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: electronically and to mediate it， right？ And so all of that data is there。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We could easily run sentiment analysis through everything that people have written
    to kind。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of get a sense of， you know， how excited are they feeling？ How is that changing
    day-to-day？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Which groups are exhibiting more engagement？ Which groups are exhibiting less
    engagement？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You do see there are some tools out there， for example， to look at Slack messages
    and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: develop these kinds of analyses。 Should we do it？ Next。 I mean， certainly， I
    think。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: on a legal standpoint， within the US， we're fine。 I think there's no expectation
    of privacy around emails。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: other things that people work， right on work technology。 So we ought to be okay。
    Ethically。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I think in some organizations， they would have no trouble doing this。 In other
    organizations。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: people might see it as a big violation of privacy。 And so it is certainly， I
    think。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: once you start going through what people are writing， at this kind of level。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: making sure people understand what you're doing with their data。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and making sure people are comfortable with it， I think it's important to maintain
    their， trust。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So you can do this whether you should， probably organizations specific。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are other ways that we can use it。 So you can also use it to think about
    what people are posting about the company on social。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: media。 Now， I think this is more fair game， right？ I mean， if it's on social
    media， by definition。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it's public。 And so looking through what people are posting about the company
    can give you a decent sense。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of overall morale。 Obviously， you're getting less information。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We don't have the kind of granularity of emails of being able to see across
    different。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: groups and across time。 We just have less data。 But it's a sensible thing to
    look at。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another place where people often use this is actually just asking people how
    are you feeling。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: about your job。 And so rather than doing these kind of long engagement surveys。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we could ask people every， few weeks， maybe every month， but you know， some
    writers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a couple of sentences about， how you're feeling about your work and the company。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/9efb988acf98fce0c0a767903c9fbc08_9.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: Okay， that open text， it's easier for them。 It provides us much richer information。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And one of the first things we can do is just do a quick coding of all of it。
    So， you know。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: what's the overall satisfaction that we're seeing here？ One of the nice things
    about this text。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it doesn't just lend itself to sentiment analysis， though。 But asking people
    how they're feeling。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it also gives us more leverage to try and figure， out why they're feeling。 I'll
    say。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: what are the themes that come out of this？ The downside is now we may have thousands
    and thousands and thousands of these sentences。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: from which we're trying to extract those themes。 So that is a great task for
    a second tool that I want to talk about。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: which is topic modeling。 [BLANK_AUDIO]。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
