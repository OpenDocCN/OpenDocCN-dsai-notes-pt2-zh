 Hello everyone。 My name is Matthew Bidwell。 I'm an associate professor of management at。



![](img/c52106a36383121db265bf0574891de1_1.png)

 the Wharton School and a faculty co-director of the Wharton People Analytics Initiative。

 I also teach courses on people analytics to both MBAs and executives。 I'm really excited。

 to be here today or whenever you're watching this， talking about AI and people management。

 So as Peter has described， managing people is complicated。 People have free will。 Not。

 only do we need to hire them， we need to motivate them。 We need to persuade them to。

 do the things that we want them to do。 And they very much react to the ways that we manage， them。

 So figuring out how to manage them appropriately is key to running a successful， organisation。 Now。

 in this course， our main goal is to describe how new technologies around。

 artificial intelligence and machine learning can create new opportunities to find better。

 ways to manage people。 Before we get into that though， I think it's actually useful just。

 to say a little bit about how organisations have been managing people so far。 After all， before AI。

 organisations had all these problems and they were thinking very seriously about。

 what they could do to get the best out of their employees。 Now， clearly， in order to。

 really get into how organisations manage people， that's 10 hours。 I want to spend 10 minutes， okay。

 but just very briefly go through how organisations thought about some of the main。

 challenges that they face and try to address these。 I want to talk about three in particular。

 that are critical to organisations and we're really going to focus on over the course of。

 these videos。 So talk a little bit about hiring， a little bit about managing workers' engagement。

 and a little bit about attrition。 So let's talk about hiring。 Hiring is a really fundamental。

 process in managing people。 After all， if you bring the right people into your organisation。

 you don't need to worry so much about training them， they're more likely to do the job well。

 hopefully they're even going to be more engaged。 If you hire the wrong people， either they stay。

 into a terrible job or they leave immediately and you have to hire all over again。 Either。

 way being able to figure out how to hire successfully is really important to organisations。 Peter's。

 going to spend a bunch of time discussing how AI can be applied in this area。 I want to spend。

 a little bit of time before then， just talk about， you know， what are the conventional。

 ways in which organisations hire people。 And I think it's fair to characterise it in some。

 ways kind of a tug of war between very structured processes for figuring out who has the most。

 potential and managerial discretion around how to hire with kind of a side order of cost， control。

 Let me talk a little bit about each of these。 So first of all， the structure process。

 So we can think about hiring。 In some ways there's a measurement problem， right？ A lot。

 of AI is about data， how we measure things。 Here in any kind of hiring， what we're really。

 trying to measure is applicants' potential。 We're trying to figure， if we bring them in。

 as employees， how good do we expect them to be？ Now， there's been basically a century。

 of research by psychologists into this question， trying to figure out how we can assess people。

 and predict their potential in different jobs。 And this is given rise to a bunch of best。

 practices that organisations try to employ。 We kind of know that three things are pretty。

 good when it comes to predicting performance。 So first of all， and most importantly， it's。

 what we call structured interviews。 What's a structured interview？ It's when organisations。

 first figure out what attributes of people are most important to do the job。 Then they。

 work out what kind of questions can we use that will actually assess whether people have。

 those attributes and they define a set of questions they're going to ask every candidate。

 And then they also have a rubric。 So for the answer to each question， they define beforehand。

 what's a poor answer， a medium answer and a good answer。 And they run every candidate。

 through this and score them accordingly。 So structured interviews， very good。 In some， settings。

 tests of cognitive ability， broader job knowledge tests can do a good job of figuring。

 out who has the abilities necessary to do the job。 And you know， some evidence that personality。

 tests can also be effective。 And so HR departments will kind of adopt these practices and try。

 and use them to do a structured assessment of people to figure out who has the most potential。

 to perform well in the organisation。 They'll also try and avoid the things that we know。

 tend not to work so well， in particularly unstructured interviews。 That is interviews。

 where we basically just sit down with people， ask them a few of our favourite questions。

 have a back and forth and try and get a good feel for them。 So that's the kind of the。

 structured process sides of hiring。 The other side I said was managerial discretion。 What。

 do I mean by that？ Well， the HR department can put all of these nice structured processes。

 into place。 But at the end of the day， in most organisations， the HR department is not actually。

 doing most of the hiring。 You know， for some high-volume entry level roles， and it might。

 go through a structured recruitment process。 But most of the time new hires are actually。

 being hired by what we call hiring managers， the kind of frontline managers for whom they're。

 going to work。 So what this means is that even though the HR department might have all these。

 structured processes， they're used to depends on whether or not the managers involve， actually。

 want to apply them。 And often it seems they don't。 And so we often find that managers。

 resist these structured processes， partly because they find it very stiff and formal。

 They like getting the way of kind of a smooth interaction with people when you're kind of。

 following down a set rubric on a questionnaire。 But also I think because we tend to believe。

 we're very good judges of character。 We're not。 But we tend to believe that we really。

 know what people are like。 We form opinions of them quickly and then we spend most of。

 our time trying to justify those decisions。 And so if you believe you're a great judge。

 of character， why would I need to follow this very structured process when instead I can。

 just chat with them。 So we find a lot of managers may not follow these processes and instead。

 basically just prefer to ask people what their spirit animal is and take it from there。

 The third piece that I mentioned about hiring is in addition to this kind of back and forth。

 between structured processes trying to get people to follow them。 There are also elements。

 of cross control。 You want to hire the right people， but you also want to do it efficiently。

 And so organizations are also spending a lot of time worrying about kind of their costs， per hire。

 So how much are we spending in terms of external spend on advertisement and recruiters？

 How much are we spending internally？ The time of our recruiters and so on in order to bring。

 in each hire。 Is that too much？ How do we bring it down？ They may also worry a lot about。

 how long it's taking to fill the job， track time to fill the job because the longer it's。

 filled the job， the longer it's staying empty and the more disruption that's going to cause。

 And so we kind of look at these as well and try to figure out how do we get our hiring done。

 properly。 I think Peter will discuss a little bit。 There can be a challenge there when inputs。

 are easy to measure and outputs are hard。 Maybe we focus too much on cross-by-hire and。

 not enough on quality。 Some organizations will also try and figure out are we doing a good。

 job of this。 So for example， you might serve a supervisors after three months or six months。

 and say， "Okay， we hired this person。 Would you hire them again？" You might also look。

 at attrition after three months or six months。 So using these not only do we try and get the。

 right people hired， but we can also start to look at the overall structure of our hiring。

 process and get a sense， is it doing the things that it's intended to？ And through the use。

 of all of these levers， organizations really try and make sure they hire the right people。



![](img/c52106a36383121db265bf0574891de1_3.png)

 effectively。 A second area of people management that we're going to talk about in this course。

 is engagement。 You know， again， coming back to this fundamental issue of people have free， will。

 So we need to motivate them to do the sorts of things that we want them to do to。

 make this organization successful。 Now， there are lots of levers that we can pull around。

 motivation。 A big one is kind of job design and structuring the exact tasks that people， can do。

 The culture of the organization and the way that people are led also helps to define。

 their relationship with it and how excited they feel about coming to work every day。

 So there are lots of things we can do。 Fundamental getting it right though is actually knowing。

 how engaged people are in the first place。 And so organizations spend a certain amount。

 of time and effort trying to figure out are our people engaged？ How do they feel about， this？ Now。

 obviously it's not always easy to know what people are thinking and feeling。

 So the standard way that we try to do this often is through employee engagement surveys。 Okay。

 I'm not sure how many of you have taken these surveys， but basically a lot of companies。

 will pretty much every year send out a long survey to their employees who are lastly。 How。

 do you feel about working here？ What do you like about your job？ What are some of the downsides？

 How do you feel about your manager？ What's your opinion about your pay， your benefits， the company。

 all of these sorts of things？ Often they tend to use very specific sets of questions。

 developed by psychologists that will really enable them to clearly tap into specific opinions。

 about each of the attributes that they might care about in their work。 Okay， why do this？

 First of all， it gives us a good sense of how we're doing overall or are people excited？

 When you do it from one year to the next， you can start to examine trends， right？ Are we。

 getting better？ Are we getting worse？ Even more importantly， you can look across different， groups。

 What are the parts of the organization where people are engaged？ Where are the departments。

 where they're disengaged？ What can we do about that？ Generally， these engagement surveys are。

 reasonably effective。 If you want to know how engaged people are， you can do a lot worse。

 than just asking them。 That said， there can be some problems。 Something I'll come back。

 to a couple of times， isn't it？ There's obviously a gap between what people are thinking and。

 what they tell you they're thinking。 For example， people might not always tell the truth。

 I remember， back in my labour economics class， one of the things that I really picked up was that if。

 anybody from your company ever asks you， "Are you paid enough？" The answer is just always， no。 No。

 I'd like to be paid more。 People may be a little strategic about trying to make， out。

 Things aren't great in the hope that people improve things for them。 On the other， hand。

 they can be worries about retaliation。 If I'm in a small group and people are asking。

 me about my manager， am I sure that my saying my manager's terrible is not going to get。

 back to her and then get back to me。 You have to be a little careful。 The other challenge。

 with these surveys is also that they're expensive。 If you're getting everybody in your company。

 to fill out a survey， that's an awful lot of person hours that are going into that。 Even。

 just the effort to make sure people fill it in is not on trivial。 To avoid those expenses。

 a lot of organisations will therefore only do this once a year。 Which， again， if you want。

 an overall sense of how we're doing， it's not a terrible idea。 But if what you're trying。

 to get is an early warning sign of problems， you're only getting that once a year。 When。

 things are changing very rapidly， and this happened recently during the pandemic， you。

 don't want to wait until next year to figure out what's going on。 That kind of the long。

 time between it and the cost of doing this turned out to be quite a challenge when doing。

 these engagement surveys。 A third area that I'm going to talk about， a reasonable amount。

 during this course， is attrition。 People leaving turnover。 There are different ways that we。

 can describe it。 Why do we spend so much time talking about it？ But I really care about。

 it because it's a major source of cost for them。 I've just mentioned it's really important。

 to hire the right people。 Well， if I hire the right people， but then they leave， I've got。

 a guy out and hire all over again。 There's a high cost of just replacing people。 But I。

 think even more than that， there's a lot of disruption that comes from turnover。 The。

 people who work with the person who's left， they've got to build new relationships with。

 the people they have to work with now。 People who come in to replace them， they don't understand。

 the organization。 They don't know those people。 It takes them a long time to get up to speed。

 There may even be some very specific knowledge about our products， about our clients。 There。

 are other people in the organization don't have and walks out the door when people leave。

 And so attrition tends to be very costly in organizations， and they spend a lot of time。

 thinking about what can we do to drive that down。 Now， again， there are a lot of levers。

 that potentially we can pull to address attrition。 We can think about who we hire。 Are we hiring。

 people who are likely to stay？ We can think about our pay package。 If we pay more， hopefully。

 people will stay more。 We can think about all the things that drive engagement。 If we have。

 better leadership， better design jobs and so on， will people say， "There are a lot of。

 levers that we can pull？" So one of the questions we want to know is， "Which ones should we pull？"。

 And so then we need to figure out why are people leaving？ So broadly， I would say there。

 are two approaches that organizations have taken to this。 One is just figure out where attrition。

 is。 So organizations will traditionally track their attrition rates。 They're basically calculated。

 as the number of people who leave in a given period， maybe six months or a year， divided。

 by the number of people who you employed at the beginning of that period。 So that can。

 be a small number。 It can be a very big number。 In some areas， say， areas of retail， fast food。

 and so on， that can be over 100%。 So again， when you track these attrition rates over time。

 you can start to look at trends。 If it's edging up， can we do something about that？ Probably。

 more than that， by looking at where attrition is higher， which departments， which jobs。

 which groups， we again can start to get some idea of what might be driving it。 Why would。

 it be that this department leaves more？ And what does that tell us about what we need。

 to do about it？ Even more direct， as a way of understanding why people are leaving， is。

 exit interviews。 So exit interviews are where people sit down with people who are leaving。

 and ask them why they're leaving。 And you can get insight from this。 Maybe a lot of people。



![](img/c52106a36383121db265bf0574891de1_5.png)

 are telling you they're leaving because they've got a better paid job。 Maybe people are telling。

 you they're leaving because another role involves more career advancement。 Maybe they're leaving。

 because their new job has a shorter commute。 And by looking at what reasons come up systematically。

 organisations are able to start getting a sense of what they might need to do in order。

 to reduce attrition。 Again， exit interviews are not perfect。 There are few limitations。

 So one is you can't even get everybody to respond in an exit interview。 If some people。

 just abandon their job， which can happen a fair bit， you never get a chance to speak， to them。

 Even more than that， there are big concerns that when people do these exit interviews。

 a lot of what they're telling you is not what's true。 It's what they think you want， to hear。

 And so people may be reluctant to criticise others in the organisation， bring， up poor management。

 those sorts of things， because they don't know if they're ever going， to want to come back。

 It may be more convenient to talk about money， whether or not that's。

 really the reason they're leaving， less clear。 And so although exit interviews can give you。

 some insight， there are some real debate about exactly how seriously you should take the， answers。

 So given the critical importance of employees to the functioning of any organisation。

 firms have put tremendous amounts of thought over the years into trying to work out how。

 do we track the basic dimensions of the employment relationship and what are some of the levers。

 that we can pull to improve it。 And you see some of the things they're doing。 Each of。

 these approaches has important limitations。 Managing people is hard。 Partly the limitations。

 come to the fact that employees are complex and everyone's unique。 Partly it's that some， things。

 particularly attitudes， just really hard to measure。 But there are other challenges， as well。

 often getting data costly when it comes to engagement surveys， those sorts of， things。

 Often we rely on managers and supervisors to make some of the core decisions when it。

 comes to hiring， even when it comes to interpreting exit interviews。 And we worry that they're。

 not necessarily super reliable。 They may have their own biases。 They may have agendas。

 that they're trying to pursue that are not exactly the same as the organisations。 So。



![](img/c52106a36383121db265bf0574891de1_7.png)

 their discretion can also create in some senses complications。 So we have a bunch of things。

 They're not perfect。 Now， I'd like to be able to say that advances in AI and machine learning。

 allow us to resolve all of these problems that you see with managing people。 Like to be able。

 to say it， but obviously it's not actually true。 A lot of these problems continue to be。

 issues no matter how much technology we throw at them。 Nonetheless， it is also the case that。

 new technologies have created opportunities to kind of do things differently， to find new。

 ways to assess who's a good employee， to find new ways to assess are people engaged， are。

 they likely to leave those sorts of things。 They don't solve every problem， but they do。



![](img/c52106a36383121db265bf0574891de1_9.png)

 provide these kind of complementary approaches。 And so what we want to do next is really start。

 to explain how these new tools work， what is machine learning， and then go on to explore。

 how they can be applied within the field of people management to develop more effective。

 solutions to a lot of the problems we've described。 [BLANK_AUDIO]。
