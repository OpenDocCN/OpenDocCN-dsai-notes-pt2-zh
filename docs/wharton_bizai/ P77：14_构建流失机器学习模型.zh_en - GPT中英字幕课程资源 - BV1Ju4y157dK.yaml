- en: When we look at these machine learning models， a lot of the clever stuff is
    actually not the models themselves。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/bd4678343f9fbf54767344a88ff8048e_1.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: It's figuring out what kind of data to put into them。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And I think changes in the way that we work and particularly changes in the
    way that so much of what we do is online。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Because there's now more and more data that goes into these that can enable
    us to get better and better estimates of who's going to leave。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So what are some of these factors that matter？ We're going to try and build
    a machine learning model to predict who's going to stay and who's going to leave。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What are some of the pieces of information that we might put into it？ So obviously
    as I mentioned。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: there's some information around demographics， the kind of job role that people
    are in。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that is very useful for understanding who's likely to leave and who's likely
    to stay。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The other thing that I think can be very useful is transaction level data。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They try on specific events that have happened to people that also shape their
    probability of leaving。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The reason this kind of transaction data data on events is useful is that turnovers
    really about change。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/bd4678343f9fbf54767344a88ff8048e_3.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: So if you think about why people leave organizations， in a sense the answer
    is obvious。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We usually leave because we think the job we're in is worse than the alternatives
    for us。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Baron also made me just have to figure out how bad the job is。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The thing that's interesting about it though is we leave because the job's worse
    than the alternatives。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but we also took that job。 So the fact that we previously took that job。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that point it must have been better than the alternatives。 So we want to ask
    ourselves what changed？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What has changed for somebody so that now they think their job's worse than
    the alternatives。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but previously they thought it was better。 And we can use a lot of HR data on
    how people are being managed to give us insight into that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So what might have changed？ One thing that can change for people that might
    make them more likely to leave is receiving a signal。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that they're not really being valued as highly within the organization that
    they thought they were。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and therefore their prospects in the future are not so strong。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So what might some of those signals look like？ So they might have changes in
    their performance evaluation。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So it might be in my performance， valuations are doing okay。 Now I'm getting
    lower valuations。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The evaluations go down。 People see they're not a good fit。 They're more likely
    to leave。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If I'm not getting raises， not getting bonuses， or my bonuses and raises alone。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that again is a pretty bad sign for me。 I'm doing less well at this organization
    than I might have expected。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and so probably I should look to leave。 So not getting raises is one thing that's
    often a red flag for people being expected to leave。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another big one is being turned out for promotion。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: People go out for promotion and they don't get it。 They're much more likely
    to leave。 Indeed。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we find more broadly that when people apply to other roles within the organization。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: often I think you see in a lot of organizations you can apply to jobs internally。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If people apply to those jobs and get rejected， again they're more likely to
    leave。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It could be written to that maybe that's partly explicitly because it's a rejection。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Sometimes it could be because the fact they're applying to jobs inside the organization。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: is a good sign they're ready to leave their job， and if they can't move to another
    job inside the organization。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they're going to move to one outside。 Either way， if we can incorporate that
    information into our models。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: whether or not they're applying to other jobs， again we have better evidence
    of their flight risk。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another piece of information about change that can predict turnover。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: is how their environment's changing。 So we know people more likely to leave
    if their colleagues are leaving。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: often described as turnover contagion。 They have all the trouble of learning
    to work with new colleagues。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Maybe those colleagues were friends， it's not as much fun coming into work anymore。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It may also just be that when those people leave it， it gives them a sense of，
    "Hey。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: there are possibilities outside this organization。"， Maybe I should be doing
    more with my life。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So when we see their colleagues leaving， they're at high risk。 Certainly when
    their manager leaves。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: particularly if it was a good manager， their manager leaves， that can be a big
    disruption。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: can lead to turnover。 More generally， reorganizations， other organizations of
    fact。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: when employees are subject to multiple reorganizations。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/bd4678343f9fbf54767344a88ff8048e_5.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: that also raises their propensity to leave。 And so we can look through all of
    the data that we're acquiring in our HR system。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and look at all of these changes， all of these different flags。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to start getting input to our attrition models to help us do a better prediction。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of when people might leave。 A second set of data that we can use to understand。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: whether people might leave is behavioral data。 What are they actually doing
    day-to-day it？ Again。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: as more and more of our lives and our workers online。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/bd4678343f9fbf54767344a88ff8048e_7.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: there's more data we can put into these models。 So a lot of people。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: once they start thinking about leaving， they start to withdraw more generally，
    right？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Their performance goes down， and so sudden declines in performance productivity。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That might suggest that they're a flight risk。 Even more so。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we can use information about how people are interacting with others。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to get a sense of whether or not they're likely to stay。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So we generally expect people who have more ties in the organization。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: or spending more time interacting with others。 Well。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they're going to get more support from those others， so that makes us an attractive
    place to be。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We tend to enjoy our relationships， and so the more kind of socially embedded
    we are in the organization。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the more likely we are to stay。 And so generally we find in studies that when
    we look at interactions with the organization。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: those people who have more contacts and those people are kind of communicating
    more with them。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: are more likely to stay。 Those people are kind of more peripheral in organizational
    networks。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Those are the people who are more likely to leave。 We even see that the quality
    of contacts matter。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So for example， the people who stay are not only the people who have more contacts。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but also connected to those people who themselves have more contact and are
    high status。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So there's a lot of interesting evidence that tracking the communication networks
    that people are part of。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: can give us further information we can put into these kind of attrition models。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to get a sense of who's likely to stay and who's likely to leave。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Understanding the role of interactions in who stays can even go further。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/bd4678343f9fbf54767344a88ff8048e_9.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: There's a nice study by a group of researchers at Stanford and Berkeley。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that looked at what people said in the emails they sent to one another。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So their theory was that the extent to which our language and an email with
    somebody else mirrors their language。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: is a good indicator of the extent to which we're kind of making an effort to
    adapt to each other。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: making an effort more broadly to adapt to the culture。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So when people use similar language to one another， it suggests they're really
    trying to fit in。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When people don't use similar language， it may suggest that they're withdrawing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And they found evidence for this。 So when they track kind of the similarity
    of the language people using in their emails with the people they're corresponding
    to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: when that similarity started to go down， when people kind of diverging to the
    language other people using。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that was also a predictor that those people were leaving。 And so it's interesting。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it's possible not just looking at who people talk to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/bd4678343f9fbf54767344a88ff8048e_11.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: but even looking at the kind of language they use can also potentially be an
    input to a model to try and build an even more accurate。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: understanding of who stays and who leaves。 I'm not even done yet。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are other things that we can look at。 Some of the most interesting comes
    from social media。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So there have been some startups such as High Q Labs and Clara Analytics that
    for a number of years have been trying to build businesses。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: around the idea that people's social media profiles can tell you a lot about
    where they're going to leave and inform these flight risk models。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I actually think there's a nice logic behind these ideas。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: All of the things that I've been talking about before。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: really being different indicators of how much people are attached to the organization
    in their job。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We've got to think about these as push factors， how much， you know。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they're being pushed out by the organization。 We also know that when it comes
    to turnover。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: pull factors matter as well。 So you know， how much am I likely to get a good
    job elsewhere？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You know， those jobs matter whether or not I leave。 You know。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we also know that most people tend to find jobs through their networks。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We find jobs through people we know and online networking has made those searches
    visible。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so by looking at people's social media activity。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: one thing we can really track is how much are they actually searching for new
    jobs and if they're searching for new jobs。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: clearly they're more likely to leave。 In a very crude way， one thing we can
    think about it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: if people are updating their profile in LinkedIn and trying to connect for a
    lot of people。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that's a pretty good indicator of job search activity。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And it does suggest this person's flight risk should be that much higher in
    our model。
  prefs: []
