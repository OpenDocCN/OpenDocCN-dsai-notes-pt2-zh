 We've talked about software skills computation。

 Last key input to machine learning is the data。 And training data is really the key to machine learning applications。

 So there's a common thought that coding and these other inputs really have a lot to do。

 with differentiating applications。 But the reality is that the training data plays a much larger role in deep learning performance。

 than almost anything else。 And so access to data is really one of the key differentiators when we're thinking about。

 performance in the machine learning world。 One of the nuances associated with data。

 with deep learning and other kinds of machine learning。

 is it turns out that as data scale increases for most traditional machine learning models。

 shallow machine learning models， performance increases but at a certain level it caps out。

 Deep learning that level is at a very different place。

 It turns out for deep complex neural network applications， the performance continuously。

 rises with data scale for a long， long time。 What that means is that for applications that rely on complex deep learning networks。

 there， are massive advantages to having huge amounts of data which is why you may hear the term。

 data is the new oil。 For complex applications， things like self-driving cars for instance。

 There are companies that have been collecting data on how to use these input data for self-driving。

 car decisions for a long time harvesting enormous amounts of data。 In a sense。

 data is the new oil in that it can provide value into these predictions in。

 a way that can't be replicated easily by many other firms。

 So there are firms that have really massive stores of data assets on everything from buying。

 patterns， if you're an online site or a credit card company to search data of course to travel。

 data。 So those massive stores of data assets are already very valuable。

 They're only going to become increasingly valuable as they can more and more easily be used to。

 make predictions in a machine learning sense。 It's also the case that you oftentimes see that there's a virtuous cycle around data collection。

 that essentially the rich get richer。 What I mean by that is that the more data you have。

 the better product you can build， the， better product you build。

 the more data you can start to collect。 So in the search engine case， for instance。

 we all may prefer a certain search engine because。



![](img/e4268559d5217c7fa5d2c298253a4485_5.png)

 it shows us the results we want， but the more we use it then， the more data they're able。

 to collect。 So it leads to a virtuous cycle where in a data-driven economy it's often the case that。

 those that are data rich continue to get richer and richer and pull away from those who don't。

 have much data and have a hard time getting started and collecting the kind of data assets。

 they need to build out algorithms that are of the same quality。 Thank you。 [ Silence ]。
