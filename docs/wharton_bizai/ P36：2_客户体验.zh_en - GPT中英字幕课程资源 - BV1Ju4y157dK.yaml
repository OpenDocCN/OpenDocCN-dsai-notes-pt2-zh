  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: In the previous one， we talked a lot about AI applications。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I think the best way to think about AI applications， is to think about customer
    needs。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And what better way to think about customer needs， than thinking about what
    their journey is like。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So if you think about a typical customer journey， it starts with awareness of
    a need。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You start thinking about perhaps you want to buy a new sweater， let's say。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Then you start looking at the consideration set， which is。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: what are the companies out there that will help， me get a good sweater。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Then you start carefully evaluating， all the different alternatives。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: perhaps make a purchase after that。 Then you go ahead and say， well， how was
    that purchase？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So if it's positive， you obviously have positive feedback。 If it was negative。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: perhaps you might have to start all over again。 But as you can imagine， in this
    day and age。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: when you start thinking about all the different AI applications， out there--
    so for instance。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: when a customer is thinking， about a sweater， let's say， let's take that example。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: he or she might be looking at Instagram。 And one of their friends perhaps has
    a nice sweater。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: on an Instagram。 Or they might go on a website。 Or they might go and look at
    customer reviews。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They might go through some of this journey， and then decide， well。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they want to start all over again， because the product that they were interested
    in is not。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: available。 What's the big takeaway？ The big takeaway is that the customer journey。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that I painted earlier， which was very linear in nature。 You have the awareness。
    Then you have。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in some sense， consideration set。 Then you have your choice。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And then you think about how good the choice was。 Nowadays。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you find that that journey is quite non-linear in nature。 And this is， in some
    sense。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a limitation sometimes。 You can think about it。 But I think from the point of
    view of AI applications。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it's quite an opportunity because consumers， first， A。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: need help to think about how to go about in their journey。 And B， for companies，
    you can then。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: start thinking about where your AI applications--， be it voice， be it vision，
    be it language--。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: whatever the case might be。 How can they help in the customer journey？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That's what we want to talk about。 With this， just stepping out of the technology
    for a second。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and start thinking about the customer journey and customer， needs。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and then start thinking about where exactly would， needs be best served。 Now。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the other thing that I want to bring up as the slide， suggests is that each
    person's customer。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: journey might be quite different。 This is about customer journey and segmentation。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/0d2d3314481808d6203fb6f648441af5_3.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: the idea that no two customers are the same。 Now， again。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you can think of this as a limitation sometimes。 You can think of it as a challenge。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But I want you to think of this as an opportunity again。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: because this is where AI and all the possibilities， that it has in terms of
    being able to customize。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: being able to understand which customer is going around。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: with journey and where they are in that journey， that's where the opportunity
    lies。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So let's take some examples to understand， how you think about these questions。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let's take a very popular example， Disney。 Many of us， of course， may have been
    to Disney resorts。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: or of course， must have heard of Disney。 Now， Disney has made a lot of investment。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and as you see here， there are lots of buzz words around， for example。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the billions of dollars Disney has spent， in the internet of things。 There's
    big data。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: machine learning， all of that。 What's the idea here？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The idea is basically around something called the Magic Band。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This person on this slide is wearing a Magic Band。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The idea is the Magic Band basically can give you， in some sense。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a lot of information as a customer， but also gives Disney a lot of information。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let me give you an example of the information it gives you。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So if you buy a Magic Band before you go on， to a Disney resort， you can put
    a lot of information。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in that Magic Band。 For example， where you're staying， if you're staying in
    the resort。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you can use the Magic Band to open your hotel room， you can add money to it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: so in the cashless transactions， you can decide， for example， which rides you
    want to go to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: so Disney used to have something called the Fast Pass before。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They've tried to replace that with the Magic Band。 Now， from a customer perspective，
    of course。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: lots and lots of opportunity， lots of interesting things going on。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But let's start thinking a little bit， from Disney's perspective。 Now。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: from a technology perspective， clearly， this is very interesting kind of lot
    of investments。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in big technology， big data， machine learning。 But let's start from Disney's
    perspective。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to think about why would they want to invest， in this technology and why would
    they care about this data。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So there are lots and lots of things going on here。 So let's take it one at
    a time。 Now。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you can imagine from an operations perspective， this is a big help to Disney。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You can imagine traffic flow is a big issue， within a Disney resort。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So you can imagine if you can go to a resort， you are going with your family。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but there are so many other families out there。 And Disney is trying to think
    about。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: what different families need， where do they want to be， what rides are they
    taking。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: what is the traffic in one particular part of the resort， how would they get
    this data？ Well。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: earlier， they had to， in some sense， somehow try to get this data from the Fast
    Pass。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But now it's all digitized。 So from an operations perspective。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they can get very quick information on the fly， as to what the traffic flow
    is like within the resort。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So clearly it helps the operations people。 Now， think from a marketing perspective。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: From the perspective of Disney， they also want to understand。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: what are the kinds of rides you are interested in？ What are the things that
    you were excited about。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: when you plan this Disney trip？ Now， clearly understanding what customers are
    going through。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: understanding which rides they want， understanding what are their expectations。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: is a huge plus for Disney， as they can personalize all of this。 Finally， of
    course。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: from a new product development， this is exciting as well。 Because you can then
    start thinking about。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: what are some things perhaps people are looking for。 Obviously， Disney has Disney
    Plus now。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the streaming platform。 So you can imagine that there is a lot of interesting。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: interactions between going to a Disney resort， Disney Plus， and being using
    all that information。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: for new product development。 So more broadly， what I wanted to think about。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and I'll give you another example as we go forward。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: is to think less about technology per say at this stage， but more about the
    customer journey。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What are customers' needs？ What are some things that will make their experience
    seamless？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And then we can start thinking about， how to go ahead and implement the seamlessness。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/0d2d3314481808d6203fb6f648441af5_5.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: using new technology。 Let's take another example。 This time from a business
    to business perspective。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Just like we talked about tracking of customers， within a Disney resort， Unilever。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the big CPG company， consumer package goods company。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they also implemented real time tracking of trucks。 Now you can imagine， well。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: these two applications are quite different。 Indeed， they are。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But let's start from the basic questions， the why。 Now why would they want to
    do this？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They being Unilever。 Now， who are their customers？ Their customers typically
    are not you and me。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: as individual customers。 Their customers are the businesses。 Now。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you can imagine what are the other business needs。 So think about retailers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Retailers want to know where is the inventory？ When are they going to get the
    next shipment？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So again， from their perspective， they would like to have much better idea。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of when the Unilever truck is coming in。 So that's one example。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another thing that Unilever had found， was that many of the retailers， that
    is their customers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: wanted to buy more frequently， but less things each time。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So before they started tracking the trucks， it was quite burdensome for Unilever。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to keep sending trucks back and again。 So that is the question I want you to
    start with。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Every time you start thinking about using new technology， the why。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: what customer needs are you solving？ Of course， after that， the how is equally
    important。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: how do you go about it？ And this is where machine learning， all of that stuff
    came in。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What did Unilever end up doing？ They started thinking about， in some sense，
    like the Uber of trucks。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: which is they started tracking where the trucks were going， how the weather
    patterns are like。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: how the traffic patterns are like， what did they want to do？ They basically
    wanted to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in some sense， to get out trucks in the most efficient manner， such that they
    can， A。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: get as many deliveries on time as possible， and B。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: also make sure they didn't have to make redundant trips。 So that's what they
    ended up doing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They basically ended up tracking those trucks really well。 They reduced their
    own carbon emission。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They actually increased the amount of stuff， that was there in the trucks。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So a win-win solution all the way through。 But notice the order of questions
    that we asked。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So why should be the very first question？ And then， of course， the how is very
    important。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That's where new technology comes in。 But I want you to think about the why。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: from your customer's point of view。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/0d2d3314481808d6203fb6f648441af5_7.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: So just to summarize this discussion that we had， before we move on to other
    aspects of the customer journey。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: these are the kinds of managerial questions I want you to ask。 Start with the
    why。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What customer needs are you solving？ Whether it's the B2C example that we took
    in Disney。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: or whether it's the B2B example that we took in Unilever。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I think customer needs are something that are quite general。 So put yourself
    in your customer shoes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Think about the hurdles that they are facing。 Think about where you can help
    them solve the hurdles。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Then start thinking about the data assets， all the other technologies that are
    necessary。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to solve that problem。 And finally， always keep the ROI， return on investment
    insight。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/0d2d3314481808d6203fb6f648441af5_9.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: Many times， we as managers perhaps， get very excited with what I call the latest
    shiny object。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I think it's good to be excited。 It's good to know what's coming， what's next。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But once you start thinking about what's， the return on investment that starts
    making you think carefully。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: about where I should be putting the money， and where perhaps I should do a little
    bit of testing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: before I decide to invest。 [BLANK_AUDIO]。
