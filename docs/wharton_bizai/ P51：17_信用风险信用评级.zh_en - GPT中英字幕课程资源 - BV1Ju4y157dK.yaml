- en: So now I want to build on what we've been discussing thus far with regards to
    credit risk。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: corporate credit risk that is。 And I want to introduce credit ratings， something
    many of you。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: which many of you may already be familiar with。 So let me put up a little slide
    here and this is really just a screen grab from a Wikipedia page。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/0ab6e2fb84a6c706253640d40761694f_1.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: Now there's a lot of information here， so let's try and walk through some of
    this。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One step at a time and see how it relates to what we've been discussing。 Alright。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: so there are actually many ratings agencies， but the three largest in terms
    of their size and breadth of their ratings。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: are Moody's standard and whores and bitch。 And the idea behind a credit rating
    is really simple。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You know， it's an attempt to characterize， not quite quantified。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but characterize the credit risk of different companies， different financial
    instruments。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So when we talk about， you know， Intel being less risky than AMD， as we did
    in our past videos。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you know， how much less risky is a natural question to ask， right。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: or how much more risky is AMD than Intel？ And so credit ratings are one way
    in which we can move closer to quantifying that risk。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: or at least providing some notion of a relative ranking。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So let's take a look at this first column on the left-hand side here， Moody's
    long-term ratings。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And we can see they run， the ratings run from AAA all the way down to single
    C。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And as we move from AAA down to single C， we're moving from less risky to more
    risky firm。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So the safest firms from a credit risk standpoint are rated AAA。 The riskiest
    firms， in fact。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the firms that are all but in default， if not in default， are rated single C
    on the Moody's scale。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Standard and whores have similar rating scales， those slightly different letter
    notations。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So standard and whores， again， starts with AAA， but rather than going to AA1。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: which is one notch below the safest， it goes to AA plus。 And on and on all the
    way down to single C。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: though， that's in some sense slightly above Moody's single C rating。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And Fitch is actually very similar， if not identical。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in terms of its long-term ratings to standard and whores。 Now。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: there's a distinction between short-term and long-term。 I'm going to put that
    aside for now。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I don't want to bite off more than we can chew well。 Let's focus on the long-term
    ratings。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: which are a bit more well-known and perhaps more widely referenced。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So each of these ratings categories you can think of as a bucket of loosely
    similar firms in terms of their corporate credit risk。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now， how does this relate to the probability of default？ So over in this column。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Wikipedia was nice enough to put up whoever constructed the page， some default
    rates。 Now。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I'm not going to be wed to them， but they will give you some general sense because
    I did check。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They are in the ballpark of the actual default rates。 Each credit rating， each
    individual rating。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: AAA， AA plus， AA， has its own default rate， and different types of default rates
    for that matter。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but I don't want to go down that rabbit hole。 So let's focus sort of big picture
    here。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For a relatively safe firm， a firm that's rated AA or above， according to standard
    and whores。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: or Moody's for that matter or pitch， what is the probability that that firm
    is going to default？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Well， it's 0。1%。 So 10 basis points， 0。1%。 That's very low。 As we move down
    the rating scales。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you can see that the probability default starts creeping up。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But notice that even as we get down to the triple B rated firms。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the probability of default is only 1%。 It's still highly unlikely that a firm
    rated triple B minus or above。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: or a firm rated B AA 3 or above on the Moody scale。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: probability that they're going to default is very low。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/0ab6e2fb84a6c706253640d40761694f_3.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: But as soon as we move below that single B AA rating。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: as soon as we move below that to the double B or the BA1。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we see a big jump in the default rate from 1% to 7。5%。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And what's happening is as soon as you cross this divide。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: so from triple B minus to double B plus on the standard and whores scale。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and analogously from B AA3 to BA1 on the Moody scale。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you are moving from what is called an investment grade rating， to a speculative
    grade rating。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And that distinction is important for a lot of reasons。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: not just because we see this almost discrete jump in the likelihood of default。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but also because there's many regulations on certain types of institutional
    investors in terms of how much money they can invest in firms that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/0ab6e2fb84a6c706253640d40761694f_5.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: or instruments that are rated below investment grade or speculative grade。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So this line that I'm drawing right here is an important delineation。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And you can see the rating description here， right？ We have investment grade
    above the line， right？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Below investment grade， sorry。 Below investment grade or speculative grade below
    the line。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So what's sort of the upshot of this discussion？ Credit ratings are sort of
    a useful characterization of credit risk profiles。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And they abstract away a little bit but are closely related to default rates，
    but getting a rating。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I like to think of it as a grade in a class， right？ A， B， C， D and F， right？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you got an A in the class， you did outstandingly well， okay？ Just like if
    you're rated AAA or AA。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that is incredibly safe。 It's a very safe， low credit risk firm。 If you got
    a B in the class。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you did okay。 It's not great， but you did all right。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So if you're rated single A or maybe high triple B， you're still a relatively
    safe firm。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: very low probability of default， but it's clearly different from a AAA or AA
    rated firm。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And likewise， for lower and lower ratings。 So they're a useful characterization
    of credit risk。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They're a popular characterization。 Though despite all the attention that they
    receive。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: relatively few firms in the economy， I mean relatively few publicly traded firms
    in the economy have credit ratings。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In fact， it's not even the majority。 It's probably around 30 to 40% if I had
    to guess based on memory。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So， you know， not many firms in the grand scheme of things have credit ratings。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but those firms tend to be extremely large and responsible for a great deal
    of economic activity。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so credit ratings rightfully so get a great deal of attention。 So that's，
    you know。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the whirlwind introduction to credit ratings， right？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They represent credit risk and delineate between different buckets of credit
    risk from low to high。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And this is going to provide the backdrop for what we want to do in the coming
    videos。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: which is start thinking about how can we model credit ratings。
  prefs: []
