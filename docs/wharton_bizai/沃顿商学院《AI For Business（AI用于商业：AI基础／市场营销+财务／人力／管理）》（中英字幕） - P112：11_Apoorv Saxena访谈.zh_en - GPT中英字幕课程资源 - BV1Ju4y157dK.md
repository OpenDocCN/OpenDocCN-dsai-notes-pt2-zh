 We have talked about using portfolios to manage AI projects。

 We've talked about the democratization going on in machine learning。

 This is a theme that I've written extensively about with， Appur Saxena who is formerly with。

 Google and helped implement many of the AI initiatives there。

 and is currently the global head of AI at JP Morgan Chase。

 These articles that we have written are available as， optional readings as part of this course。

 I encourage you folks to take a look at it。 Now let's jump into a conversation with Appur。

 So Appur as the global head of AI， clearly both you individually。

 but your organization as a whole is investing a lot in AI。 When companies are investing a lot in AI。

 the question is what are the things that need to be in place for you to get returns out of it？

 Because as we have seen， there are many companies that are investing in AI。

 but not just seeing the returns。 So tell us how you think about this。

 What is an AI strategy that you find works， well and is likely to produce returns in the long run？

 >> That's a very good point。 I think one thing to note is it's very easy to get started in AI。

 I think literally you can hire few data scientists。

 give them a laptop and they should be up and running doing AI or。

 doing machine learning or data science。 I think where you're hiding is how do you have huge impact。

 transformational impact in AI？ I think there are three ways we have seen that work across。

 One is you have to have the right infrastructure to do AI at scale。 And what does that mean？

 Essentially it means having your data in place。 Data easily discoverable， easily annotated。

 And then ability to train models， large scale models。

 So that's essentially what I call AI infrastructure。 And Facebook， the Google。

 the world invested heavily in this。 And that's the reason they have been able to leapfrog the industry。

 The second piece is you have to look at your business processes from end to end。

 perspective and see how AI can be applied。 End to end process。

 rather than a small piece of the overall process。 And the third piece I would say。

 you have to come up and， you can use AI and should use AI to create new digital experiences。

 And this is where you will see the most impact over time。

 >> What's an example of a new digital experience that you can create through AI？

 >> So I think AI has been unable to do， has been able to do amazing sort of。

 new experiences through conversation。 Speech to text accuracy has increased a lot。

 Ability to create new text， completely AI generated text has increased a lot。

 So now you can think of experiences that were just not possible two or， three years back。

 just two or three years back。 So the correct example。

 and if you're talking in the private world space， there are a lot of low touch。

 high frequency transactions that you typically， as a bank want to automate。 Example of， hey。

 you wake up in the morning and you want to check your portfolio， how is it doing and why is it down？

 So you wake up， talk to Alexa， one of the digital experiences assistant and， say。

 why is my portfolio down by two percent？ And then the AI assistant goes and dissects your portfolio and。

 comes up with very good reasons of why it is down and gives you that transaction。 Of course。

 in all this experience， if you want to dig deeper and go very deep。

 you actually call your wealth advisor。 But that's the kind of experiences that we're talking about。

 >> So it's certainly clear how you can apply AI to improve existing experiences。

 But when you talk about creating new experiences， what exactly do you mean？

 >> So AI has enabled a completely transformational experience in how you。

 converse with machines and how you can generate new text， machine generated text。

 So these two advances can be applied to transform how you interact with a bank。 So give an example。

 typically a low touch， high frequency interaction with。

 your private wealth advisor is typically something that bank want to automate。

 And an example of this is you wake up in the morning， you talk to Alexa through your。

 bank through Alexa and say， hey， how is my portfolio doing today？ How did I do yesterday in fact？

 And it says， hey， it's down by two person and then you start digging deeper into， hey。

 why is it down by two person？ It says this is how your portfolio is constructed and。

 this is the reason why it is down and so on and so forth。

 So that kind of interaction is very low touch， very high frequency。

 But something that you easily can automate it today。

 And that's the kind of experience that I'm talking about。 >> Well， there we have it。

 three pillars that approve as suggesting。 The first one being before we embark on big initiatives with AI。

 let's make sure the underlying infrastructure， the data infrastructure and， platforms are in place。

 The second is don't think about individual touch points alone， but。

 in fact think about entire end-to-end processes and look at how AI can transform。

 that entire process。 And lastly， use AI certainly to transform existing experiences， but。

 also think hard about how AI can create completely new experiences for。

 the customers and those can be strategic and game changers for the company。 >> Upward。

 thanks again for joining us。 >> Thank you for having me。 [BLANK_AUDIO]。
