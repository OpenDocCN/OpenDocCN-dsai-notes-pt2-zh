  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the development of computer systems that are able to perform tasks that normally
    require。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    decision making。

- en: When we talk about artificial intelligence， there are many kinds of AI。 For
    example。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: one can think about weak AI and strong AI。 Weak AI， also known as artificial
    narrow intelligence。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: is the kind of AI that is very good at a very specific task。 For example。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you might have a chess playing AI that can probably beat the world's best， chess
    grandmaster。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but it is only good at that one task。 The same AI probably cannot converse with
    us。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It probably cannot recognize images and so on。 Similarly。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you might have AI that is good at product recommendations， but is not good。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: at chess or recognizing images。 In short， these are AI that are good at one
    narrow task。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Most of the AI around us tend to be weak AI， but the goal of the field is eventually
    to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: build what is known as strong AI or artificial general intelligence。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is a computer program that could do all intelligent things that a human
    can do。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so this kind of AI would be truly intelligent and would be close to a human
    being at a wide。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: range of tasks。 And finally， you have the notion of artificial super intelligence。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is an AI system that is a strong AI。 It's as good as humans at a lot of
    tasks。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    data。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    intelligence or AI that is better at humans at most tasks。

- en: The history of AI is very recent。 The field owes its origins to a paper written
    by mathematician Alan Turin。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: who asked the， question， can machines think？ Having had the contention that
    machines can be constructed which can simulate human mind。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: very closely。 In fact， he proposed a test which is known as an imitation game
    or also popularly known。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: as the Turing test for machine intelligence。 In the test。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a human judge interacts with two computer terminals。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the computer terminals is controlled by a computer and the other terminal
    is controlled。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: by a human being。 The judge interacts and has a conversation with each of these
    through the computer terminal。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If the judge cannot distinguish between the human being and the computer system，
    then。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    think？

    by mathematician。

  prefs: []

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    we might interview doctors。

    antibiotic， treatment。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now that's a rule that they might give us and we might program many such rules
    to diagnose。

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    of drivers and ask them。

    of techniques and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    beat human beings。

    diseases can do reasonably well but it cannot often。

    is the idea。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    they。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    rules are。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    knowledge we all。

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    of some。
  prefs: []

    the information。
  prefs: []
