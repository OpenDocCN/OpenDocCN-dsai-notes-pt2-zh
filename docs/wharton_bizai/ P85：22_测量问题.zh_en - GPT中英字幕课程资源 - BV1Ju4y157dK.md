 So a really central problem in applying machine learning to human behavior is that we never。

 have all of the measures that we want。 But even beyond that， we have a second problem。

 which I've come back to a few times over， the course of these videos。

 which is that even the measures that we do have can often， be inaccurate。

 So when we're trying to understand how people perform， how they'll behave， what they'll， do。

 all of these sorts of things。 What they're thinking， their attitudes。

 their state of mind are really important。 I've talked a lot about this when it comes to assessing engagement。

 One of the things that I've tried to emphasize is that there are lots of useful things that。

 we can do to really start to understand their engagement。 But all of those methods are flawed。

 So we've talked a lot about， do people really want to tell us how they're feeling？

 And so people may be very strategic。 There are other things that。

 if you think about surveys when we survey people， people， may misunderstand the question。

 If you talk about analyzing text， people may be answering slightly different questions。

 and that can affect the sentiments that they describe。

 There are other issues when we try and study people's attitudes。

 What we really want to know is the fairly stable attitudes。 When they come in on the average day。

 how do they feel about their job？ But any time we measure it， we're measuring it at a point in time。

 which may not reflect， how they're going to feel tomorrow。

 You also have problems whenever you do surveys that some people kind of fill a man in different。

 ways。 There are some people who love to fill in the extremes。 Everything's either a one。

 it's terrible or a seven， it's great。 There'll be much more measured。

 Everything's either a three or a four。 So some of the core things that we want to measure。

 we're always measuring it with air。 We do that。 We have these problems with surveys。

 We have these problems with sentiment analysis。 Anyway， we're trying to get at these attitudes。

 So if we only have a very rough approximation of what people think in our data， that also。

 is going to make it harder for us to make accurate predictions。 So with these models。

 we have to be suitably modest。 They can be very useful。

 but we always have to remember every model is based on incomplete， data。

 There's a lot of things about people we'd love to be able to measure， but we just can't。

 And they're also based on inaccurate data。 So all of our measures would lock their bed than nothing。

 but we have to remember they're， always noisy measures。

 We can never really get a clear handle on what people are thinking and what they're， doing。
