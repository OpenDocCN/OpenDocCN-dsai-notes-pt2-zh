    technologies。

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Well， the first one， Mary， is personalization。 The more we understand about
    the customer and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you know， we have a lot of customers come through。 We do about 60 million per

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And the more we can leverage that big data to understand each individual customer。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the more we'll be able to offer a personalized experience that's better for

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    a survey on a receipt and we do about 60 million of those a year as well。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And with all of that data， we're able to use AI to mine the information and

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    for customers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and we can understand where we're having some shortcomings that we can shore
    those up。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we should be able to grow the business。 Well， that's an explosion of data and
    that goes along with the explosion of evidence that AI applications across industries
    are happening。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So I understand that something very unique is happening at McDonald's as you
    are applying both AI and robotics to improve the all important drive through experience。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So， could you potentially describe what and how the guest experience is benefiting
    from this type of innovation？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Yeah， sure。 You know， the drive through is very important to McDonald's and
    it went from about 50% of our sales to over 60% of our sales during the pandemic。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's been a very important channel for us。 And， and so we have a lot of customers
    that come through the drive through。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What we've done is we， a couple of years ago， we acquired a company called Dynamic
    Yield。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: who's experts at personalization， and they had been primarily doing work in
    the website area。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And what we've been able to do is leverage that into the drive through。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So when you come into the drive through the machine， we'll take a look at， okay。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: what's the weather out today。 One of the last 10 cars ordered。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: what do people usually order at two o'clock in the afternoon on a Tuesday and

  prefs: []

- en: So as you start ordering also， hey， what goes with a double cheeseburger and
    those suggestions will appear in real time on the menu board。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And that has been a real， you know， success story for us in driving up sales
    and increasing customer satisfaction。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And now with AI， we， a lot of companies are using natural language processing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    are being impacted by using natural language processing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    of the company。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You know， an example， just going back to this， these customer satisfaction with
    the receipts。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we can， we can mine the real text。 If you go in there， you say， okay， scale
    one to five。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: how was your experience。 But then type in comments。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And if you have millions and millions and millions of comments。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it's really hard to do any to look through that and understand what's happening。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But we can use AI to mine sentiment so we can understand how customers liked
    a particular。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: maybe new product that we've launched。 We can also understand whether our new
    safety protocols that we put in for。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: for COVID are giving customers a good experience or not。 And then based on that，
    we can do that in。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in real time， get that data real time， we can do that in real time and provide
    very。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: very quick feedback to all the way down to individual restaurants。 So that we
    can， you know。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: improve and， and leverage that to offer a better experience and grow sales。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So AI is actually it's not only helping consumers with personalization but helping
    the operations at each individual store。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we're giving real time feedback through these different tools。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So this leads me to a broader question。 How is McDonald's approach to a different
    than five years ago？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What the， you know， it's changed a lot。 I would say， Mary， the five years ago。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it was very interesting。 And then， a year ago， it was very ad hoc， you know。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: so it was a new capability， new technology， certain parts of the company were
    able to leverage more than others。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But it was very new。 And then we started to experiment more。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And now I would say that AI is something we're going after with the real strategic
    intent from the top down。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And then we started to work with the data and analytics hub in the center。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And the idea here is to put in place a center of expertise with real capabilities。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: advanced knowledge and understanding。 We've got some centers that we got through
    acquisition in in both Silicon Valley and in Tel Aviv。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And then out of the spokes of those hubs are practitioners in different parts
    of the business different countries different functions。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And those practitioners are going through and saying， Okay， well， this year。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: these are the different things I want to be able to do。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And we're able to put the right attention resources focus in the highest priority
    areas of the company。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So it's， it's very much a， a， a， a normal business practice that we are taking
    with strategic intent。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: just like being faster in the drive through or having more delicious food。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So we've talked about how AI is applied to specific business problems like the
    drive through an innovation well innovations in the drive through as well。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And McDonald's and types of AI technology that are being used like natural language
    processing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So now， could you talk a bit about when do the business units pull in that or
    connect with the data scientists。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And， you know， bring them into that customer business problem or guest business
    problem。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So how do the technologists and the subject matter experts work together to
    innovate at McDonald's you talk about the center of excellence。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but maybe you could talk about those two， two groups。 Yeah， absolutely。 So in
    my department。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: for example， which， you know， I run this global insights group。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but you could substitute the global insights group in France or the operations
    team in Germany for those。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And typically what they'll do is they'll bring business problems。 I've got this
    business problem。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And I'm either trying to grow sales or have better promotions or understand
    my business a little bit more。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so I want to be able to look at historical data and understand what the
    impact was of this new product or。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: hey， I launched this new product at the same time I launched delivery at the
    same time I had this promotion going。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: How much of the sales were coming from each one。 And they'll bring those forward
    and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and either somebody from the center of expertise or somebody from the business
    who has links into the center of expertise will you'll tackle that problem and
    leveraging AI tools。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There's so much democratization happening。 There's brand new tools and platforms
    that are available in the market that are helping us to be able to arm folks out
    into the business units with the kinds of things that they're going to need to
    run their own analyses。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And that's fantastic。 You know what we don't want to have is a is one group
    that does all the work。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What we want is one group of experts that helps the rest of the company to do
    their work。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so that's the kind of thing that we're trying to put in place now。 So thinking
    about a tool。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Can you highlight potentially the key elements to building out good a be testing
    tools and models。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And what your team needs to consider when using advanced AI and machine learning
    methods with a be testing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I'm glad you asked that because a be testing is a super important part of working
    with AI and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you know， it is something that should just be natural， you'd be something that
    just sort of is。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: is going along with putting an AI project in place。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Because of the speed that you can do you can you can obtain by using a be testing
    very。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: very quickly very real time。 You can you can generate， you know， improvements，
    you know。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: on a daily basis or maybe even hourly basis。 And many people don't know that
    when you go on to do in a news website all those headlines have been a be tested
    to drive the most clicks possible。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And， and so， you know， what we want to try to do is bring that into the physical
    space。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so we're doing that with our outside outdoor digital menu board you mentioned
    the drive through earlier。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: when you drive through that big canvas of an outdoor digital menu board with
    those beautiful pictures of our。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: our food。 You can do a lot with a be testing there in fonts in size in placement。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We could run a test that says okay at three o'clock in the afternoon we're going
    to give more real estate to coffee。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Less real estate to other items because people need that afternoon pick me up。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So we can do all of these kinds of a be testing and very quickly determine all
    the way down to a restaurant level。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What the design of that， you know， opportunity in the menu board should be。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And in order to drive sales， you know， for the for the company。 So it's a tremendous
    tool。 And。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and we use it， you know， rigorously in all of our different applications。 So
    in your opinion。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: if the founder of McDonald's Ray Crock was alive today。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What would be the one AI or machine learning innovation that would wow。 Ray
    Crock。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I know he was very famous for his shake machine。 But what would wow him now
    about a machine learning。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Well， we still do have that shake machine at headquarters。 It's a it's a it's
    a revered gem。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But one of the things that we're working on and testing right now actually is
    voice automation in the drive through。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Basically having an AI bot be able to interact with the customer and take the
    customer's orders as they go into the drive through。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And what the what that can do is if we connect that to the offers we're showing
    on the menu board or with loyalty program。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A person could drive up in their car。 They can be greeted by name。 Hello， Mary。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Thank you for coming to McDonald's and hey， it looks like you have 200 loyalty
    points left。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Would you like to order a cheeseburger。 These kinds of things offer really interesting
    personalized experience。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The other thing is that bot can speak multiple languages or if we're running
    a Disney promotion。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: maybe it's in Darth Vader's voice。 And so those are the kinds of things that
    we should we're able to do now。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And I think that sort of innovation and technology probably would would knock
    Ray's socks off if he had a chance to see it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I think so as well。 I want to end。 I want to thank you so much for your time
    today。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It was great getting to know you and McDonald's use of AI on the business。 Thank
    you。 Okay。
