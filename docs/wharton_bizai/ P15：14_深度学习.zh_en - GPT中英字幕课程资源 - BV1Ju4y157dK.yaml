- en: call structured features are passed to an algorithm which learns the best mapping
    based。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: on some examples you give it。 So think about the data as being organized kind
    of like a spreadsheet。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You have an outcome that you want to predict and then you have a number of columns
    which。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: have data on predictors。 You need to have data in this format where you have
    structured columns that describe the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: data you're trying to predict。 As we've talked about earlier。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: when working with unstructured data it requires a feature。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: engineering step to take this raw unstructured data and generate these features。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To turn it into a format where you can have columns of data that can be used
    to predict。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: some output。 Again， it takes quite a bit of work to figure out how to take this
    raw unstructured data。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and to generate these columns。 How to choose what the appropriate columns are。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: how to actually create the columns given， the structured data and so on。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so what happens is engineers take this raw data， they'll create these features，
    run， the model。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If the performance is too large， if it's unacceptable， they might try a new
    set of features or just。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the features that are used in the current model。 Again， a lot of domain expertise
    is required。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: right features to extract。 Especially with some types of unstructured data，
    images， sounds， essays。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it can take， a considerable amount of domain expertise or expertise about the
    knowledge area to understand。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/1023754b656e00c83629e3997fdc0888_5.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: how to convert that raw unstructured data into usable features。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One example of this might be medical diagnostic imaging。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Imagine an X-ray where you're trying to understand how to use that data to predict
    whether or。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: not somebody has a condition。 If you think about an X-ray and if you think about
    what you might want to pull out of that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: X-ray or that image to predict whether somebody has a condition， it requires
    a lot of expertise。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: medical expertise in particular to understand what you're looking at and how
    to know what。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in that image is worth identifying。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/1023754b656e00c83629e3997fdc0888_7.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: It might be something to do with the color shade or certain portions of the
    image or looking。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: for some things appearing in the image that you might not normally expect。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But it takes somebody with a great deal of medical expertise to be able to know
    that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And then that person will have to sit with a developer to help understand how
    to take an。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: image like that and pull out the relevant data。 So that's an example of you
    might need a number of different types of expertise to be able。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to take raw data like a medical image and pull out data that can then be put
    into a column。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: format to be used for prediction。 For some kind of medical outcome。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: like whether or not a person actually has a disease。 And again， this requires
    domain expertise。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It requires developer time。 It requires considerable resources。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It can be quite error prone as well because the number of features you could
    pull out。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of an image is immense。 So making sure you have the right ones is a process
    that's inherently prone to prone。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/1023754b656e00c83629e3997fdc0888_9.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: to error。 We talk about deep learning。 What deep learning does is eliminates
    much of the need for feature extraction。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So in the normal machine learning workflow， you have some kind of input data
    and then you。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: have a feature extraction process where people have to sit down and figure out
    what features。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to pull out of the input data to get it into that columnar sort of spreadsheet
    format that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: can be then used for prediction and then you get your output。 When you're using
    deep learning。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you skip that feature extraction step。 Deep learning is going to allow us to
    go directly from this raw unstructured input data directly。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to making predictions that provide value for us。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/1023754b656e00c83629e3997fdc0888_11.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: So why is deep learning a game changer？ The reason is because this feature engineering
    step is particularly expensive。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Again， it requires a lot of domain expertise。 It's error prone。 It's heavily
    uncertain。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so when we're able to use deep learning to skip that feature engineering
    step， it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: can lead to massive improvements relative to a process where we have to sort
    of hand code。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: or hand select what features to use。 The prices we'll talk about is computation。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but computation is getting cheaper， making deep， learning more feasible for
    a variety of applications。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And this is going to let us predict from unstructured data at scale。 So again。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: think about images or online text like reviews or customer satisfaction forms，
    health data， audio。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and so on。 So for any prediction or classification task。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: this is going to be an application of substituting。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: more and more data with labeled examples for expertise。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/1023754b656e00c83629e3997fdc0888_13.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: We no longer need the domain expertise required to hand code or pull out features
    because。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we have a whole lot of data that we're going to be able to use to let the machine
    learn。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that piece of it itself。 So a few examples here。 Example one is something like
    image recognition。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So if you want software that can basically recognize people's faces， this is
    an example。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: where you can take raw image data and train it to recognize people's faces without
    having。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to go through the process of identifying， say something like the space between
    people's。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: eyes or the length of the width of the face。 You don't have to do any of that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you can just use the raw image data that's labeled。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: with the right people and it will essentially learn to recognize people automatically。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another example is detecting fake news。 How do you tell if a piece of news is
    fake news or real news？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A process that requires feature engineering may require you to sit down and
    try to understand。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: or figure out what it is about a message or a news post that may signal that
    something， is fake。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's very hard to do， make news is getting better and better in terms of authenticity。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What deep learning is going to let us do is just take lots and lots of examples
    of news。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We don't have to know what matters in terms of prediction， just the raw news
    post itself。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the label about whether or not it is fake or authentic and it's given those
    two pieces。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of information that deep learning engine will figure out what is relevant in
    the post and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: what is not in determining whether something is fake。 We don't have to tell
    it that piece。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A third example， detecting knockoffs from luxury products。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You have images of luxury products and you're trying to develop something to
    determine whether。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: or not it's authentic or whether or not it's counterfeit。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/1023754b656e00c83629e3997fdc0888_15.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: What you might do in this case is have lots and lots and thousands of images
    of a particular。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: product， maybe a scarf or a bag and just labels of whether or not that product
    is authentic。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: or counterfeit。 We don't have to sit there and tell the machine learning engine
    what to look for in the image。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We just feed it lots and lots of images and the right answers， the labels and
    in this。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: case the deep learning engine can automatically figure it out。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What it is about the images that might be signaling that something is a knockoff
    or if。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it's authentic。 Thank you。 [ Silence ]。
