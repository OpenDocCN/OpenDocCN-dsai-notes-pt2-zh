- en: So last video， we talked about firm practices such as organization structures
    and how skills。

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: should be distributed。 In this video， I'm going to talk about other managerial
    practices and employee management。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: practices associated with AI。 And this is really fundamentally motivated by
    the fact that growth in AI and related。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: investment has been extremely rapid in the last couple of years。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And how does that change the employee compositions？ Specifically。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: how should managers react to this growing investment in AI？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And what kinds of firm practices are needed to accommodate this change？ Not
    just for innovation。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but generally this rapid automation on various types of work。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/2e51f0bfd5f948ac1118c54dbfd1339d_3.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: And you probably heard a lot of these type of articles in popular press about
    how robots。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and AI are potentially causing a huge turbulence in both employment and managerial
    practices。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You probably heard a lot of articles about jobs for robots， the fact that robots
    can， be now。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: then AI robots will destroy all our jobs and we're still not ready for it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And this is published in Foreign Affairs， Harvard Business Reviews， and even
    policymakers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in European Union has proposed some kind of robot tax。 In the 2020 presidential
    campaign。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: de Blasio famously proposed a robot tax to Buddhist campaign， before it flamed
    out。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And Bill Gates also proposed that maybe robots should be taxed as human。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: These are sounds interesting， but fundamentally we actually do not know to what
    extent is AI。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and robots really affect employment and to what extent do managerial practices
    need。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to accommodate these changes。 So before we start with any kind of policy implications。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we should actually have hard， facts on how does AI and robots change the nature
    of jobs。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And we actually did a nation study in the entire country of Canada。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We actually captured all the robot adoption in specific firms in a very fine
    detail level。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And this again， this study is using tax taxation data and also census data。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That means almost all firms need to reply for compliance。 So we got like 80。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 90% all firms in Canada responding to the survey。 You can see that robot adoption
    is rapidly growing in services compared to manufacturing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So this is a little bit different than what we thought before that robots is
    really affecting。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: manufacturing。 But here we actually see robot adoption speed growth is actually
    in services。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: especially， in recent years。 Of course you see the one of the biggest adopters
    for robots are manufacturing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And you see that in other industry， heavy machinery industries。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And you also see the growth being quite rapid in healthcare， in scientific research，
    and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: also in other services。 So again， this is not just a manufacturing story。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but it's really a global economy story， including both manufacturing and services。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/2e51f0bfd5f948ac1118c54dbfd1339d_5.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: So we've seen that robot or AI adoptions have increased dramatically over time。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And AI may mirror that adoption pattern and growth may even be faster as a new
    generation。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of AI becoming more used in mainstream。 And in our study。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we actually seen that our productivity associated with robot adoption， is quite
    high。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's actually 10 times factor share。 So what does it mean is that if you adopt
    robots and a perfectly equilibrium。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you should， get exactly the value of your robots。 So it's similar to how much
    investment。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But here I'm telling you is that the productivity associated with robot options
    is 10 times value。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: time time factor share。 So it means there's a huge productivity improvement
    associated with robots。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And a dispersion of that is quite high。 Some firms do really well with robots，
    some firms don't。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That suggests complementary organization changes are happening associated with
    robot adoption。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/2e51f0bfd5f948ac1118c54dbfd1339d_7.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: To give you an idea of what exactly is going on with robot and employment。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We break it down into both employment and also with managers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So contrary to the popular narrative that robots killing all jobs， you see on
    the left， hand side。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it's the event study basically you can read the zero being the year your。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: dot robot and native number are the years before your dot robot。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So negative two means two years before your dot robot being a firm or being
    a firm adopting。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: robot and a positive value two means the two years after your dot robot。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And the y-axis is what is the effect of robot on a changed employment。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You can see that before firm adopted robots， this virtually is just hovering
    around zero。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Robots shouldn't have an effect on employment when they don't invest in any。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And on zero you see an increase in employment。 And gradually increase after
    two or three years。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Even in plateaued after five， six years， it's still higher than the initial
    level。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So it's actually opposite of popular narrative that robots actually increased
    employment overall。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But this effect is not uniform。 If you look at the right hand graph。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you almost see the exact opposite pattern。 But this graph is instead of measuring
    total employment。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you're measuring how many managers， are there before and after you dot robots。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So before you dot robots， again it's hovering around zero。 And the year you
    adopted robots。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: managerial employment has gone down quite a bit。 In plateaued a little bit for
    a year or two and another big decrease after a year three。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/2e51f0bfd5f948ac1118c54dbfd1339d_9.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: or four。 It's different from what we think。 So why will robots increase employment
    but decrease managers？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It seems almost counterintuitive because managers by definition manage other
    people。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: How could we replace them with robots？ Are robots really our managers？ What's
    going on here？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And this is not a statistical fluke。 If you look at managerial employees between
    the two types of firms。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the robot adopting firms， the blue lines， the solid blue lines， and the non-robot
    adopting firm。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the dash-red lines。 And we plot a share of managerial employees over time。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You can see the robot adopting firms are gradually reducing the share of managers
    and employees。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Whereas the non-adopting firms for robots have pretty much constant share managers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So it's really something about robot adopting firms that are changing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Not the non-robot adopting firms。 So why managers？ Well。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: maybe because managers are really expensive。 So maybe if you want a cost cut。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you want to get rid of them first。 Interestingly， we can actually measure that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In part of our survey， we actually asked this question， which of the following
    factors was。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: respect to the relative importance to your workplace general business strategies？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And one of the questions I want to ask is reducing labor costs and really important
    strategic。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: priorities or is improving product services and a few others too。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/2e51f0bfd5f948ac1118c54dbfd1339d_11.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: And notice， when we linked reducing labor costs as a strategic priority to robot
    adoption。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the fact size is zero， and almost no relationship between the two。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But if you were firm strategic priorities was to improve product services， that's
    highly。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: correlated with the propensity to adopt robots。 So it's really not about cost
    cutting here。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but it's really about how do firms improve， product services that ultimately
    drives the firms with adopt robots。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So it's not about managers being really expensive。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So why does AI and robots have profound effect of managerial employees and also
    managerial。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: practices？ The true reason for that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/2e51f0bfd5f948ac1118c54dbfd1339d_13.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: Number one， remember the graph I showed you earlier where it decreased dramatically
    first。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and then it plateaued and decreased again two years later。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you think about automation technology as enabled by robot and AI， a lot of
    reporting。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: tools like who showed up on time， whether they done the thing they should be
    doing， clock。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: can clock out， and these types of work can be relatively managed by technologies
    already。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So it kind of leaves a lot of managers with other types of work。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It was a supervising role that has decreased quite a bit。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So there's probably a immediate effect on technology effect。 Basically technology。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we play some of the managerial functions。 But still they're managing people。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Technology can capture some of the monitoring technologies， can capture some
    of the aspect。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of them supervising roles， but cannot be capturing all or even not most of it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Remember two years later there's another dip。 And that is likely to come from
    the fact that employment composition has fundamentally。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: changed after a robot。 It's being adopted。 So what do I mean by that？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/2e51f0bfd5f948ac1118c54dbfd1339d_15.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: So I actually disaggregated the total employment by the skill type they have。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Are they highly educated？ Are they middle skilled or are they low skilled？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: High skilled being you have university degree for your graduate degree。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And middle skilled being you have some， you graduate from high school and you
    have some。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: kind of accreditation。 Two years， so two degrees， some kind of trade skill accreditation。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And low skilled being people who have just high school degree or less。 Okay。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So if you look at the robots effect on the high middle low skill workers， look
    at how。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: different they look。 The first bar is just total employment。 I showed you that
    already。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So each bar here is we're measuring the effect of robots on the total employment
    on high school。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: employees and middle skilled employees and low skilled employees。 So each bar
    is the effect。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So notice that high skill has gone up。 The demand for high skilled workers has
    gone up quite a bit after a robot。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Compared to low skilled workers， it's much smaller。 Low skill has increased
    quite a bit too。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So both high skill increase was low being much more than high skills。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But notice the middle skilled workers on that bar is a big negative number。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So although robot has increased unemployment for all workers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the effect is varying his heterogeneous。 You see a huge effect。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: positive effect on low skilled workers。 Some effects positive effect on high
    skilled workers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but very negative effect on the middle， skilled workers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That's problematic because that changes the type of people that managers are
    needing to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/2e51f0bfd5f948ac1118c54dbfd1339d_17.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: manage now， do supervise now。 When you have such a large change in employment
    composition。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the type of managers you need， will also need to evolve。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So what does it mean to manage a very high and very low skilled workers are
    going to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: be very different from managing middle skilled workers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Low skilled workers are working very much standardized。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You can think of picking and packing on Amazon warehouse。 You have camera， you
    can， you know。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: looking out there， showing up on time or not。 You can have each scan code on
    the product。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You know exactly how many boxes were product and process。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So all of that can be traced and monitored。 So you probably don't need many
    supervisors to teach low skilled workers how to do their。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: jobs。 Little training needed and much of it is standardized and can be easily
    monitored using technologies。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So compared middle skilled work， you probably need less supervisors。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But managing high skilled workers is also very different because these people
    are probably。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: expert themselves。 They probably know how to do their jobs better than their
    supervisors and their managers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So their managers are probably more acting like a advisor， a coach and helping
    them to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: do their job as supposed to telling them exactly how to do it。 So again。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the type of manager or managerial skills needed to manage high skilled workers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: can be quite different from middle skilled skilled workers。 So again。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: because of this employment composition change， you see a lot higher low skilled
    workers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and a lot lower middle skilled workers are moderately high skilled workers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You really need a different type of management。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/2e51f0bfd5f948ac1118c54dbfd1339d_19.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: So as a result， you see that manager on average has gone down。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And that is because most of the most of the employment increases coming from
    low skilled， workers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/2e51f0bfd5f948ac1118c54dbfd1339d_21.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: If most employment has gone to a high skilled worker， you may have a different
    result。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You may not have seen a drastic decrease in managers。 That's before。 But either
    way。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the type of people we manage can be different。 Therefore。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the type of managers you need are different。 Number is gone down。 But more importantly。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: firm practices are changing to accommodate or to co-evolve with robot adoption。
    So specifically。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we looked at three different firm practices。 First we look at span of control。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: How many people are being managed by a single manager on average？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So if our results are correct in the sense that there are many more employees，
    a lot。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: fewer managers， on average span of control should also be going up。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A lot more people under single manager。 We independently measure that we ask
    the ash manager how many people are managing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We have independently confirmed that span of control has indeed gone up。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So managers have to manage a lot more people than they had before。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We also look at work predictability。 To what extent can you actually predict
    your hours when you need to do？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And if you think about that robots are doing all the predictable part because
    you remember。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: AI machine learning a great prediction machine， mining patterns that we haven't
    seen before。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And using that pattern to predict what's going to happen next。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If all the predictable elements are going to be done by robots， maybe leaving
    workers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: with all the unpredictable parts。 And you have indeed seen that work and predictability
    has gone up quite a bit after robot。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So this also suggests that nature work is changing。 And lastly。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: if you think about robots can decrease the variance in production， remember。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: robots using algorithm can do the same thing over and over again without being
    tired， without。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: taking a bathroom break， without taking a lunch break。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They can do a 24/7 in a dark room without ECU。 And that reduction variance could
    also mean that the fact that what you produced can be。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: more attributed to your effort， your abilities as opposed to some random noise。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So now the firm may be able to more accurately capture what exactly is your
    contribution。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to production process。 By more easily attributing to your performance to the
    actual effort what you actually did。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: individual pay performance could also go up。 And we have indeed shown that performance
    pay have gone up after robot has been adopted。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But again， these are evolving。 We're just scratching the surface here。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But overall we do see that robot is dramatically changing firm practices， especially
    in how。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/2e51f0bfd5f948ac1118c54dbfd1339d_23.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: people are being managed。 And lastly， I want you to show that this dramatic
    change is not just about people。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but also， decision rights allocations。 Who are making decisions for these tasks
    in the firms？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And you see that this is robot adoption is also changing who deciding what。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So in the first one we asked who deciding who gets trained for what？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Before an effort robot adoption， this is what we see。 We see that middle bars
    management。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Managers are making a lot of less decisions on what you should be trained for
    and what。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you should be trained for。 Where employees are doing most of that decision for
    themselves。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the left most bar， nine managers。 So decision rights are shifting from managers
    to non-managers on the decision on what type。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of thing they need to learn， what kind of thing they need to train for。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For CEO upper level management， that fact is pretty much zero。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So it's really about decentralizing that decision rights for managers to non-managers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We also see decision rights for the choice of production technology。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Who is making the decision on what production technology to use？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Here again we see managers losing that decision rights。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We see that managers no longer making that decision as much as that decision
    is moving。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: toward the CEO， the C-suite and the C-suite managers。 We see that for non-managers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: there's really no effect there。 For managers， middle level managers， a big decrease
    for owners。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: CEO level， that decision， rights has gone up。 You can see not only the managers
    are decreasing in their pure number of headcounts。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but what， they do have fundamentally changed and the decision rights are also
    being centralized。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: decentralized the way。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/2e51f0bfd5f948ac1118c54dbfd1339d_25.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: This is a very subtle story than before because when we think about it， robot
    AI are not supposed。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to change managers because they manage other people， people manage other people。
    We haven't。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the fact that robots can perform managerial tasks is something kind of far-fetched。
