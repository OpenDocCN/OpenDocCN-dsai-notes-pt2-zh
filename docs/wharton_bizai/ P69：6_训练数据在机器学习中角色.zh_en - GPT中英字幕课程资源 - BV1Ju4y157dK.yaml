- en: The key to developing machine learning systems is being able to feed the algorithm
    examples。

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: from which it can learn。 This is called training data。 And so again。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: this is the key to these systems。 An algorithm uses these training data to be
    able to learn the right mapping function you。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: might say between the information that's being fed and the final prediction
    that it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: needs to or that's going to arrive at。 These examples which we call labeled
    data are examples that can be used to teach the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: machine and you can think about them as illustrating the right answer for different
    case conditions。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So going back to our applicant screening example， you might think about applicants
    applying。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: with different types of backgrounds。 If you have a database which has lots of
    examples of applicants applying with different backgrounds。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and labeled data， these are the decisions that were actually made historically
    by an HR。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: practitioner by a recruiter。 This teaches the machine what to do under the different
    conditions。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So by looking at the examples that it's given by looking at the different applicant
    backgrounds。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and what the decision maker did in those different contexts， the machine learns
    how to think about。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the different case conditions and what decision to arrive at。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now if we think about the resurgence in AI， the growth of interest in AI which
    of course。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: has been quite dramatic recently， most of that has been around machine learning
    and most。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of that has really been driven by the expanding availability of large sources
    of training data。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So these two points are kind of linked in a very tight way。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/4e25c34022f1a1e9cb5d2921f1fb4525_3.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: Think about the growth of machine learning。 The reason machine learning has
    been so successful is because it can be built using training data。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and training data is becoming more and more easily available in a variety of
    different。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: application contexts。 So lots of places you can get training data or corporations
    or firms can get training data。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So archival data is probably the most common place。 So this is historical database。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Firms have enormous databases on historical information。 There's going to be
    prices。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: there's going to be marketing， there's going to be accounting， there's going
    to be HR。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Lots and lots of sources of archival data in the firm that can be used to train
    machine。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: learning systems。 It's often the case as well that you can generate training
    data。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You can generate databases that have examples using various platforms。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So let's say you had a data set of information of let's say you had a data set
    of again going。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: back to our applicant example， a data set of applicants and you wanted to generate
    decisions。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: even if you didn't have historical data available。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You could have somebody in the firm sit down and make decisions artificially
    just to create。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that guidance， those labeled examples for the machine learning algorithm。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You could also outsource those to a platform。 There are lots of platforms out
    there that will take in information and start to label。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it or make decisions for you so that you can use that data for training data。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You can use that for examples to build an algorithm。 So again。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: just to put this in the context of a workflow for a different example， let's，
    talk about X-rays。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So one place AI machine learning has really taken off is in diagnostic imaging
    in the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: medical domain。 So some modern systems， machine learning systems can look at
    a medical image and make a prediction。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: on whether somebody has a certain health condition or not。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This obviously has tremendous potential benefit in the health domain for both
    the practitioners。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and for patients。 So how you would do this in the machine learning workflow
    is you would want lots and lots and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: lots and lots of images and a column of decisions that doctors historically
    made about patients。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: with those images。 If you fed that data into a machine learning system， so again。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: all you're feeding into the， system is the images themselves and the decisions
    that were made by say the radiologists。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That is all the machine learning algorithm would need to learn to mimic the
    decisions。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of a highly trained healthcare worker who could look at images and make predictions。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So I'd never need to step back and learn anything about medicine。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I never need to even really discuss with the radiologist what they're looking
    for in the， image。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: All I need is just a data set which has thousands and thousands of images and
    the final decision。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that was made and the machine learning algorithm can then do the rest。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It can learn the right mapping between the image data and what decision it should
    come， to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And this is why this is exactly why the AI economy values data so much is because
    this。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: is the relationship that's really driving AI。 That's the availability of data
    like those data sources like this or really what's making。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the application of machine learning to so many contexts possible。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So just to summarize the last few points here， expert systems require no data。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Rule based systems require no data。 They require a human expert to specify how
    people should be thinking in terms of decision。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: making and maybe a developer puts that into code。 Machine learning requires
    no experts but it does require examples generated by experts。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It requires data that an algorithm can then use to find the correct mapping。
