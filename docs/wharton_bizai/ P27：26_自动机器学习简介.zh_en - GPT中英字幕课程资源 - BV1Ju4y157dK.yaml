- en: AutoML is short for automated machine learning， and the goal of AutoML is to
    automate as many aspects。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of the machine learning process as possible。 When we think about machine learning。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: there's a data acquisition phase。 You have to prepare the data， then there's
    feature engineering。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: feature extraction， feature selection， all these stages。 Before you get into
    the model。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: then you choose a model。 You have to think about tuning the parameters and so
    on。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There's a whole bunch of stages involved， when we think about building a machine
    learning model。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And the idea behind AutoML is to automate， as many of these parts as possible。
    And the goal。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the marketed goal in a sense， by companies that are starting to offer AutoML
    solutions。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: is to make machine learning expertise in a sense， or make machine learning more
    available to anyone。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: regardless of whether or not they have any expertise， in machine learning。 So
    for example。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: looking here at Google's cloud AutoML， solutions， so as you can see here in
    their first line。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: right at the top， they're saying that you can train， high quality custom machine
    learning models。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: with minimal effort and machine learning expertise。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And what these AutoML models are essentially doing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: is substituting in enormous amounts of computation。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: so that you don't have to worry as much about some， of the particular choices
    that you're making。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in the machine learning workflow。 So AutoML is going to let you train。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: some of these high quality models。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: And it's going to take away some of your choices。 You don't have to worry so
    much about some of the choices。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And there's different applications of AutoML。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/d7441b5f6ac37256af847016a4798e00_5.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: and this Google offering， at least。 And again， a number of different companies。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: have solutions related to AutoML。 They use different names sometimes。 Google
    uses the name AutoML。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/d7441b5f6ac37256af847016a4798e00_7.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: But they're all very similar in that they're trying。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to automate as many parts of this process as possible。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/d7441b5f6ac37256af847016a4798e00_9.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: So you can see here they have applications to vision。 They have applications
    to natural language。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And we'll do an example of that using a natural language， interface， translation，
    and so on。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: But these are all going to take some of that unstructured data。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and allow you to use that to make predictions。 [BLANK_AUDIO]。
