- en: beyond just fraud detection。 In the conversation with APU， we talked about some
    of these examples。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but in this lecture， we're going to go into the details of how we can apply
    machine learning for a variety。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of different needs within financial services。 To begin with。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: let's talk about identity verification and authentication。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is extremely important in financial services， because if you're allowing
    consumers to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: transact or to move money around， we want to make sure that the person who's
    actually。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: initiating the transaction is who he or she claims to be。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so we need to do identity verification。 The traditional way of doing verification
    of identities by using passwords or using pin。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: numbers， but the application of machine learning would be in terms of biometric
    identification。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example， to do face recognition or to do fingerprint recognition or to do
    voice。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: recognition in order to identify who's actually interacting with the company
    on the website。

- en: or on a mobile app。 Now in terms of these applications。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you can imagine a situation where a customer is trying to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: log into their bank account on a website or on a mobile app， and we might ask
    the person。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

- en: to take a photo of themselves as part of the login process or speak into the
    device or。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: perhaps use their fingerprint to try and log in。 And so these are some examples。
    In fact。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in banks in China， it is not uncommon to have ATMs use face recognition。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So when a customer walks in in front of the ATM， a camera that is on the ATM
    might actually。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: recognize the customer and then authenticate them and allow them to use the
    ATM。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And this is in fact being used by multiple banks in China today。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And biometric identification needn't just focus on things like a person's fingerprint。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: or their voice。 Over time， companies and researchers are also testing other
    ways to do customer identification。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: such as look at the unique ways in which they hold the phone or the unique ways
    in which。

- en: people tap the phone。 This technology is not mature enough。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's not clear whether it will actually be used in practice。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But today there are multiple uses of biometrics for identification and all of
    them tend to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: rely on machine learning to do the identification。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The advantage of these kinds of techniques is of course the added security that
    biometrics。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: provides relative to things like passwords。 Of course， a limitation is that
    they're not foolproof。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They do not guarantee that a fraud is not occurring。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But certainly they can help minimize it quite significantly。

- en: Another application of machine learning is in loan and insurance underwriting。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So if you look at loan approval decisions， it's made today by loan officers
    based on。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: some information about customers。 But increasingly there is interest in applying
    machine learning algorithms to either guide。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: or make the loan decisions themselves。 So these algorithms tend to typically
    be supervised machine learning algorithms so they get a。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: training data set。 The training data set would include a number of features
    or covariates or X variables which。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: is customer data such as their age， their income， their employment， their past
    history。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    variables such as what is their credit。

    or whether。
