- en: As more and more people are using machine learning， as more and more businesses
    are。

  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: using machine learning， there are a growing number of tools to help understand
    a little。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: better teach how machine learning is working， what the different choices are
    that you can， make。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: what the trade-offs are。 Here's an example of one which is called TensorFlow
    Playgrounds。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A TensorFlow against Google's package here which encapsulates a lot of steep
    learning。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: logic and there are a number of other options as well。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Google has been a leader in terms of making some of the tools like this available。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They have an interest of course in making it as easy as possible or transparent
    as possible。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: for people to use their software and to understand how the different pieces
    and elements kind。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of fit together。 So this is TensorFlow Playground。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is one of many tools that are available online to understand how different
    types of。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: deep learning or machine learning， deep learning work。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So TensorFlow Playground is essentially just highlighting or illustrating what
    the different。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: choices are you have with the deep learning networks。 We're talking about deep
    learning。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We've talked about how you feed data into the network。 There's neural network
    that runs。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: learns how to predict。 There's not a lot of domain expertise required but there
    are a number of hyperparameters that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: still need to be tuned and adjusted for the network to learn efficiently。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Learning engineers have to understand how these parameters are best tuned in
    a way that makes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: prediction as accurate as possible。 This is just an interface that lets you
    play with some of those kinds of parameters to get。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a feel for what they do and how neural networks are how they fit together。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So we talked about neural networks being composed or deep learning networks
    being composed of。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a number of hidden layers。 Here you can adjust or decrease the number of layers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is going to be a deep learning engine that takes a number of points and
    classifies。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: them or basically draws a boundary which serves as a classifier。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So one way to think about machine learning or deep learning if you have a set
    of points。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: is to think about drawing a boundary between them。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/bf44eb145f2b04e17cdf2465ad1c25b9_3.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: The idea is given points like this， where's the best place I can draw a boundary
    such that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: if I said everything on one side of the boundary is category A， everything on
    the other side。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: is category B that I'd still be as accurate as possible。 Where's the best way
    to draw that boundary？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so this is going to let you start with a number of different point distributions
    and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: start to look at how the network performs under different assumptions in different
    parameter。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: settings。 So in this case， if I can always run the network here and you can
    change these parameters。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So if I run the network here， it's going to draw a line and split these points。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is a training data set that I'm showing you here。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So what it's going to learn to do probably is split it somewhere along the diagonal
    and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: say that everything on the top right of the diagonal is going to be whatever
    category。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: blue corresponds to。 Bottom left will be whatever category or is corresponds
    to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And the idea is that whenever I get a point then that comes in this space in
    the top right。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it'll be categorized in the future。 It'll be categorized as blue or whatever
    category that is。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And same thing with orange here。 So if I run this。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it'll probably create a line somewhere down the diagonal here。 So it's thinking
    about it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And the main thing to know is that it's basically showing you or illustrating
    how the deep learning。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: engine is thinking。 It's showing you the output of the layers of each different
    node in the layer and how they're。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: combined to create the next step。 And so this is， again。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: another -- it's a tool to learn how deep learning engines， how， they're built。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: what different parameters can affect their performance。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I can start to adjust the activation functions。 I can adjust the learning rates
    and the noise and the training data。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/bf44eb145f2b04e17cdf2465ad1c25b9_5.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: So I can make these various adjustments and see how they affect how well the
    deep learning。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: network learns and how it makes predictions。 [ Silence ]。
