  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/57a61cf8f5bbcf17ac314b08fa211a23_1.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: With sentiment analysis just gives you a kind of value， positive versus negative。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: topic modeling is about trying to figure out what are the different themes being
    talked about。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in large bodies of text and being able to code each of the different pieces
    of text。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to tell you which theme is present。 How do we do this？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/57a61cf8f5bbcf17ac314b08fa211a23_3.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: I think to understand again it's useful to think about if you were just telling
    a friend。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: who was zero emotionally intelligent academic， we're trying to explain to them，
    how do you do this？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: How do you go through all this text and extract the key themes？ What might you
    do？ Actually。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: as a nice example here， in one of my classes I asked my students to write a
    very。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: short description of the culture of the last organization that they worked at。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So I've got a few of them here。 So imagine that our task was to figure out what
    are some of the main dimensions。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: along which people describe organizational culture？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What are the things that come up frequently when they describe the culture？
    What would we do？ Well。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we can read through these。 And after reading through them we can start to see
    are there some common themes that emerge？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I think there are。 So for example， a couple of them talk explicitly about work
    hard play hard。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: so that seems to be a dimension。 Another thing that came up a lot was kind of
    collegiality。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: so people talk about being collegial， collaborative， one of those sorts of things
    team based。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you know， maybe impact。 It would be another one， someone talks about big societal
    challenges and impact oriented。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So you start to see some themes emerge。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/57a61cf8f5bbcf17ac314b08fa211a23_5.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: So what we do is we start to list those themes。 Now， our friend is wondering，
    okay。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but I see those in a few。 I've got to go through like 500 or 1000 of these。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and I've got to figure out， you know， how many of them are talking about collaborativeness。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: how many of them are talking about work hard play hard。 How do I do that？ Let's
    say to them， well。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: let's take each of these themes。 And for each of these themes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: what we can do is we can build a little dictionary。 Okay。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we can identify words that are associated with it。 So for the work hard play
    hard， well， you know。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: work is going to appear a lot， but certainly play and hard。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If the theme describes play and it describes hard and it has the word work in
    there as well。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/57a61cf8f5bbcf17ac314b08fa211a23_7.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: that's probably about work hard play hard。 For collaborative。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we're going to use words like collaborative， collaborate， team， collegial。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: all of those sorts of things。 Okay， and so for each theme。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we can create a set of words that are associated with it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So that's the basic of what topic modeling does。 So what it does。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it assumes that when we've got lots of different documents and lots of descriptions
    of the culture。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: or their work or something， the people described， each of those documents will
    contain a finite number of topics。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So there's a few themes that occur in each of them。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So one person describing the culture will talk about work， life。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: balance and impact somebody else might talk about it being collegial and hard
    work。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Each document has only a couple of topics， small number of topics。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and each of those topics is associated with a number of words。 And so again，
    if it's collegial。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: those words are things like team， collaborate， collegial and so on。 Okay。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: now we don't actually see the topics， right？ If you think about what the computer
    sees。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it sees all the texts。 So it sees， you know， here's each document。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and each of those documents has a set of words associated with it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But it then tries to figure out what a set of associations between topics and
    documents。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and between words and topics， would be most likely to lead to this distribution
    of words across topics。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Okay， and so it uses just all of the words in the documents to try and figure
    out which words belong together in topics。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and in which of these topics is present in each text。 Okay， so that's all that
    it's really doing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It does have a couple of important limitations， so I said that， you know， we
    have to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the computer doesn't see the topics， it figures them out。 Actually。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it can do that for an infinite number of topics。 And so what the computer doesn't
    do a good job of telling us is how many topics are present。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so one thing we usually have to do is tell it， okay。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: let's say there are 15 ways of describing culture。 If there are 15 ways of describing
    culture。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: what words would be associated with each of those different themes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and which document would contain each of those different themes。 So that's one
    limitation。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We have to tell it how many topics to look for。 The second limitation is。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: doesn't actually tell us what those topics are about， right？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So it just tells us there is a topic that appears in these documents and has
    these words associated with it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So what we end up doing is looking at all of the words associated with the topic，
    saying， okay。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: these are all the words， this has to be what the topic is about。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So it's a little fussy to do it in practice。 But I have to say， I've tried it
    a few times。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: sometimes it works well， particularly in large documents。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so it's a way of extracting kind of key themes from large volumes of text
    and then being able to code each of those different documents。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and say， okay， this aren't， you know， if we want to just pull out all the answers
    that talk a lot about work-life balance。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: this would be these。 It can be very impressive。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/57a61cf8f5bbcf17ac314b08fa211a23_9.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: There's a nice example of this that was done in a study by some people at Stanford，
    and Berkeley。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: when they try to measure culture across organizations。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I don't know how many of you have come across the website Glassdoor。 So what
    Glassdoor is。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: is it's a website where you can go and basically write about your company's
    culture。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: what it's like to be employed there。 And so the idea is that it's mainly for
    job seekers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: so you can find out about every different organization。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: because in order to learn about other organizations， it encourages you to describe
    your employer。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Which is really cool because what it means is suddenly we have millions of people
    who've written about their employers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so we can start to see what do they write。 And so in this study。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: what they did was they basically just pulled out every sentence that contained
    the word culture to try and understand。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Again， when people write about culture， what are they writing about？ They， I
    think。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: used about a hundred topics。 They said there were probably a hundred different
    dimensions of culture。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And what I've got here is some examples of the topics that they came up with
    and the words associated with them。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And we can see some of them work really well。 So for example。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: if you have a topic on hostile management， what are the words associated with
    it？ Well。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: obviously management and employee， that appears quite a lot with them。 It's
    like hostile。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: unprofessional， abusive， favoritism， bullying， bad， horrible， rude disrespect。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It seems like this is picking up a very clear theme。 If you look at work-life
    balance。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: work-life balance， good， healthy， flexible， personal， some of the other seem
    a little stranger。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But again， you kind of see it throughout， it's picking up similar words。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so you were able to start to pull out a bunch of these themes from different
    texts。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so this is how we can use topic modeling in practice。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/57a61cf8f5bbcf17ac314b08fa211a23_11.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: So we can ask our employees in pulse surveys and other kind of short questions。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Just tell us a little bit about what you're liking and what you're not liking。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What would you like us to know？ Get fairly short answers from them。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Then we can end up with multiple thousands of these in an organization。 By running
    topic modeling。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we can very quickly identify for all of those thousands what are the themes
    that appear？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: How common are those themes？ By looking at it over time。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we can look at things like how are themes changing？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Which themes are becoming more common and less common？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Which themes do we see kind of being more common in each department？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so not only can we kind of talk about the sentiment。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but even get a sense of what people are worried about。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and do this at scale over time in a way that yes， we could pay somebody to go
    through and read all of them。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But we can do it so much more quickly and so much more effectively。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/57a61cf8f5bbcf17ac314b08fa211a23_13.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: And so when it comes to how we track engagement， machine learning has opened
    up some really interesting possibilities。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: particularly when it comes to finding different ways to get a sense of what
    people are feeling。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So with sentiment analysis， we have a great way of taking any form of text that
    people are writing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and getting a very quick pulse check on what's the overall level of positivity。
    With topic modeling。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we can go way beyond that when people are filling out surveys， doing other things。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: giving us open text and give us a great way to analyze that text and very quickly
    pick out the key themes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that are most common and see how those are changing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: These applications I would say are still kind of in the early days you're seeing
    a number of companies starting to employ them。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: particularly when it comes to things like topic modeling to analyze text。 But
    in the future。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I think there can be a very valuable tool when it comes to tracking engagement。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and a nice compliment I would say to some of these kind of more arduous annual
    surveys that we continue to see。
  prefs: []
