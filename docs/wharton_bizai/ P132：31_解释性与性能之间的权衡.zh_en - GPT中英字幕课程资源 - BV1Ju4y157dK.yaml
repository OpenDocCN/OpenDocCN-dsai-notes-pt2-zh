    why not just make。

- en: every model explainable？ Well， it turns out that there's generally a trade-off
    that arises between performance。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and explainability， especially in complex data environments。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So there is a performance penalty often when you think about using explainability。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So one can think of perhaps a trade-off between the predictive power of an algorithm
    and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: how explainable it is。 So business rules， as we talked about before， are relatively
    explainable。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: simple decision， trees or linear models are explainable。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but they are limited in their predictive power， relative to more complex applications
    like neural nets。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As we get to neural nets， they have much higher predictive power， but they are
    harder， to explain。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And of course， we'd like to kind of find the sweet spot that arises between
    maybe having。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: both models that are both highly predictive and explainable， but those can often
    be hard， to find。
  prefs: []

- en: '![](img/24822a157a05fa0d4a1c1fc2d25ef05c_3.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: So when you do have context that you're thinking about an algorithm or use of
    an algorithm。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it's often the case that you have to balance questions of precision。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Do I want this algorithm to be very precise in its prediction？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But I also perhaps need to be able to justify what the model is doing and why。
    So for example。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in a loan processing or a healthcare context， if I have a very predictive。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: model that's not explainable， that may be unusable。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so that's sort of the trade-off that arises with these two factors。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And also leads to kind of a difficult question from a organizational context
    of values perspective。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: is how do I think about when explainability is more important than accuracy？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/24822a157a05fa0d4a1c1fc2d25ef05c_5.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: So for example， in a healthcare context， you may have a system in place that's
    highly accurate。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that is recommending treatment for people in a way that has been highly accurate
    in the， past。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but also it's not explainable， which is a significant drawback because doctors
    want。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to be able to explain to patients why a decision is reached。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A doctor wants to understand the algorithm if what they're thinking is not consistent。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: or the algorithm is recommending。 And so having a lack of explainability is
    a major drawback。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so in contexts like that， the question of which one is more important， having
    an algorithm。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that's more explainable or more accurate， it's not always easy to decide which
    of those。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/24822a157a05fa0d4a1c1fc2d25ef05c_7.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: to prioritize。 For instance， there are some contexts clearly where being explainable
    does not matter。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you're thinking about just predicting user clicks or maybe recommending whether
    to buy。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: or sell a financial asset， it may not matter as much whether the algorithm is
    explainable。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's not the decision is not being made on people， they don't affect people
    directly。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: so it's not as critical。 But for something like promotions inside an organization。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it may matter a lot。 So for some contexts， explainability shouldn't matter。
    In that case。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you may want to optimize predictive accuracy， but in some cases， it's going
    to， matter a lot。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And then you have that difficult trade-off to make about which matters more
    for this context。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and how you think about balancing precision of your predictions or performance
    of your。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: predictions with the explainability of the model。 [ Silence ]。
