- en: managing people and human resource issues broadly。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This may be particularly relevant for folks who are coming to this topic in
    order for。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the first time。 So let's talk a little bit about what we know about managing
    people issues。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: particularly， as they intersect this topic of data science and the underlying
    paradigm of optimization。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So if we turn back the clock 100 years or so ago to the beginning of the modern
    factory， era。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: one of the things that you would have seen， and a lot of this actually happened
    in， Philadelphia。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: which before the Civil War， 1930s or so， Philadelphia was the second largest。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: English-speaking city in the world and a great manufacturing center in the United
    States。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And if you went into a factory around Philadelphia， around 1900 or so， one of
    the things that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: would have surprised you if you stopped and asked people is that a lot of the
    people working。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in that building were not employees。 They were independent contractors。 And
    by some measures。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: by about 1910 or so， as many as 40% of the workers in U。S。 factories。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: were actually independent contractors， not employees as well。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the things you also would have seen is that the organization was really
    chaotic。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It was just a mess inside the building。 And you could sort of see why。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: just from that earlier description， you have a building， you have an owner who
    owns it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But he's also got all these contractors in there who are working kind of by
    themselves。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And sometimes they actually got a piece of the action that is a share of the
    profits that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: came out of the business as part of the work that they did there。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The other thing that we would see is if the people came and left and new workers
    came tomorrow。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and existing ones left。 The turnover in these factories， 300% or so， was not
    uncommon。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And the management practices were really， really casual。 So， at this point。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the world's largest manufacturing operation was near where City Hall is now
    in， Philadelphia。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It was the Baldwin locomotive work。 They made trains。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And here's how the foreman would operate at the Baldwin locomotive work。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They would go in at the beginning of the day and they'd see how many workers
    from the day。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: before showed up。 And if they were missing two， you didn't have time off and
    policies for sick leave。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you were missing two that day， they would go out to the gates of the factory
    and there。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: would be a crowd of people looking for work and they would throw a couple of
    apples in， the crowd。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If I needed two people， I threw two apples。 If you caught an apple， you came
    to work for me。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You followed me into the plant。 Somebody else on the other side of the plant
    is short three people。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They might throw three pairs into the crowd。 You got a pair， you work for him，
    you got an apple。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you work for me。 Pretty simple， pretty straightforward， pretty fast， but also
    really chaotic。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And one of the things that companies began to discover slowly， first at the
    Ford Motor， Company。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: is that this system of really high turnover and really casual work didn't work。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: very well once people stopped working simply with their hands。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Hammers and saws and carrying stuff around。 So on the assembly line， for example。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Ford Motor Company realized when they first started。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it up that the cars were terrible coming off the assembly line。 They didn't
    start。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they wouldn't work， they were missing parts， it was just a mess。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And one of the engineers had the idea that maybe this had something to do with
    the incredibly。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: high rates of turnover。 So Ford ran a big experiment that called Henry Ford's
    $5 a day plan。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And if you knew economic history， you may have heard this description。 Ford
    famously says。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '"I want to pay my employees enough so that they can afford to buy my cars。"。'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That isn't why he did it at all。 He did it to got turnover and he did a bunch
    of other things that he invented as well at。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the time， like exit interviews， asking people why they quit。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What they said is much the same thing they say today， "I hate my boss。"。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So he fires the supervisors， brings in new ones， creates a department of industrial
    sociology。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: he calls it， he did double the wages， turnover falls like a stone from 300%
    to about 50% per， year。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: almost within a week or so。 And they discovered that the quality of the cars
    jumps enormously。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So we think about assembly lines as being really low skilled kind of jobs。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But if you make a mistake on an assembly line， it is way worse than if you're
    making a mistake。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: working with a hammer by yourself because you stop the assembly line。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And you might break a very expensive piece of equipment。 So Ford begins to discover。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: as other employers do as well， that stabilizing your workforce， really matters，
    talent management。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: getting those right people in the right jobs really， matters as well。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The other big development starts at the Western Electric Plant， maybe about
    10 years later。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: or so in the mid to 1920s or so。 Where they began playing around with work design。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it first started as part of a government study， to look at lighting。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And the idea was maybe better lighting would improve performance。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And you may have heard of this if you've ever taken a psychology course。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This study was done at the Hawthorne Plant of Western Electric where they made
    telephones。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And what they did is they took out the lights and they put in new fluorescent
    lights and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they discovered productivity went up。 So they thought， "Great， that was obviously
    lighting， great。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we learned that。"， Being good researchers though， they put the old light bulbs
    back and they discovered that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: productivity went up again。 And what they learned from this eventually was that
    it wasn't the lights at all。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It was talking to the employees， asking them how things were going， asking what
    the new。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: lighting was like， paying attention to them seemed to matter。 So Western Electric。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: although the study on lighting went away， Western Electric decided， to keep
    playing around with it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And they had this small part of the phone assembly operations where they just
    played。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: around with different ways of organizing work， paying more attention to workers，
    paying more。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: attention to their needs and interests。 And into this came a guy named Elton
    Mayo who began his career at the Wharton School。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I should have said earlier that Frederick Taylor who created this model in the
    first place。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of scientific management that his industrial engineering applied to work also
    began his。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: career here around Philadelphia。 His great patron was Joseph Wharton who ran
    Bethlehem Steel。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And what Wharton had done， you see hired Frederick Taylor to come in and see
    if he could make。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: his workers more productive。 And Taylor's insight was that you could take jobs。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: break them down into individual tasks， and treat them as if they were kind of
    a machine。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So we'll take a job a machinist is doing， we'll identify each separate task
    the machinist， has。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and we will see whether we can break those up， give the simpler tasks to unskilled，
    workers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and keep the machinist doing just the things that are unique to machining。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We break those down into parts， we can time them， we can see how long each one
    should take。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and then we can start telling the machinists exactly how much to do， how long
    it should。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: take to do each task， hold them accountable， and move them along。 Back to Elton
    Mayo。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: he's the opposite of Taylor。 He started the Wharton School， he moved to Harvard
    Business School。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and they went to， this Western Electric study and began to check it out and
    follow it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And they thought there was something really interesting going on here because
    in these。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: small groups they could see productivity differences going up by orders of magnitude，
    you know。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: five times greater when the employees were being engaged in this more。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So Mayo creates literature and a set of theories called the human relations
    movement。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Basically boils down to workers have psychological needs， they're not simply
    rational machines。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that you can tell what to do。 But if you pay attention to those needs。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: productivity and performance would go up dramatically。 So after Mayo in 1930s
    or so。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: some people grabbed this， so demings， Edward's demings， with the quality guru
    in World War II。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: he had helped the U。S。 improve quality in manufacturing， during the war time。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: was really important then。 But then after the war the engineers came back in
    and we more or less had Frederick Taylor's。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: scientific management approach。 Break jobs down， time them， set standards。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: pay people for achieving them， etc。 By the 1970s though。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we discovered the manufacturer wasn't working very well， we had a lot of， problems
    with quality。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: etc。 And we started to see during the oil crisis Japanese cars coming to the
    U。S。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Real efficient small cars， they started to get a market share。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But then the other thing we discovered was that the quality of these cars was
    really， better。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And we discovered that the Japanese had learned to adopt the demings quality
    approaches。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: particularly， quality circles， which mean you're empowering the employees to
    make decisions over quality。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/fac0f7084ad41552f20d3c3617af9697_3.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: They're checking， not somebody at the end of the line， they're responsible if
    the quality。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: isn't good， they're going to try to fix the quality。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The last step in this in terms of lessons from Japan was to learn about the
    Toyota manufacturing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: system， which they called Lean Production， we call Lean Production。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And this was a model that went a step further from the quality circles。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Here workers and their teams are empowered to fix quality problems， find them
    and fix， them。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but also to figure out how to make their part of the operation more productive，
    how。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to move the cars through faster， maybe with less labor， maybe sometimes even
    with fewer。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: parts or cheaper parts。 And so we moved from industrial engineering， Frederick
    Taylor。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: assembly line， quality circles， empowering the workers on quality， lean production。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: empowering them on quality and productivity。 To this last step in the mid 2010s。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: coming out of information technology， which was the， rise of Agile Project Management。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And Agile Project Management was the discovery starting in software first， that
    the best way。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to manage software and get it built was to empower these teams， leave them alone
    basically。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: support them， give them what they need， when they need it， and let them decide
    not just， quality。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: not just productivity， but even design issues to figure out the best way to
    meet the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: customer needs at the end。 A lot of face-to-face interaction， a lot of communication。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a lot of transparency。 So this is what Douglas McGregor and it described in
    our introduction would refer to as theory。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Y。 So we went from recognizing at Western Electric that this really mattered
    to pay。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: attention to worker needs to the quality circles where we start to empower them
    on quality。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to lean production where we empower them on productivity， to Agile where we
    empower them。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: on virtually everything。 So what's the theme about theory Y？ It is empower，
    empower， empower。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let employees do more and more。 Now in order to make this work。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you have to surround the employees with a system that， supports all this。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The reason this is important is because when we talk about data science now，
    we're talking。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: about introducing it into some systems which are already that far along in empowering
    employees。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So it means we're going to be talking about how data science can make decisions，
    but it's。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: going to be in this context where a lot of organizations have already had their
    employees。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: making a lot of these decisions themselves。 We talk about managing people as
    well。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In addition to these questions of how we organize work， there's all kinds of
    things we。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: have to think about that affect how employees are motivated， which means how
    much are they。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: going to get done。 What are the behaviors like how do we pay them？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: How do we measure their performance and decide what's good and what's bad？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What is their relative pay compared to other people？ They care a great deal
    about that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And what is my perceived contribution versus others relative to my pay？ This
    is a fairness question。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: quirky thing I learned from my MBAs here over 30 years or so we've had the same
    midterm。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: exam for incoming MBA students asking them to write about their last job。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The main reason they quit their last job is because of these fairness issues。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That is mainly they perceived that they were getting more done than other people
    and it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: wasn't being recognized。 So there's all kinds of issues that matter to employees
    that are going to affect their。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: performance， which is going to affect the organization's performance。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And data science in this context have to be very careful about not messing that
    up。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let's talk a little bit about some of the policies and procedures which are
    in place。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: around managing people that go outside of simply performance。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Employers also care about things like these days， the demographic balance of
    the workforce。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: across racial groups， across gender and sex based groups as well。 Diversity
    and inclusion。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: an important topic today。 We're interested not just in having people hired who
    we think are the best performers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but we're interested in having an overall workforce that represents the demographic。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: balance in society。 We are interested in the public perception of our workforce
    practices。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We want to be seen as a good employer and a desirable place to work。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You know a few years ago there was a movie called The Intern that some of you
    may have， seen。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's been a few years now。 Google is the site of that movie and as I understand
    it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Google supported that movie， financially and you may wonder why would they do
    that？ Well。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: because Google's brand as an employer is being broadcast out and Google benefits，
    from that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And it reminds us that in addition to just having effective work practices，
    it matters。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: whether people believe and see that what you are doing in managing people is
    something。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that is desirable。 Of course， the other thing which looms large in the US。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in other countries it's equally， important。 This executed differently is compliance。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And compliance when you think of human resources in the US a lot of people begin
    to make a。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: frowny face because they're thinking about the legal issues about being sued
    for discrimination。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: or actions that affect people with disabilities or wage an hour violation。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So there's all kinds of things that constrain what otherwise might be optimal
    decisions。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: with their respect to performance and productivity but they have to play within
    the lines of these。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: legal issues。 So there's all kinds of parameters here to worry about。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And into this jumps data science， right？ And data science begins with the assumption
    of optimization。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We can optimize on one outcome at a time。 So if for example we want to say we
    want to hire the people who are going to be the best。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: performers on this job， that sounds reasonable。 Okay， how do you measure performance？
    Okay， well。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: performance appraisal scores。 Okay， it's pretty good。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But does that include whether they're going to quit？ Well， probably not。 Okay，
    does that matter？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Yeah， it probably does。 Okay。 How about their interpersonal skills and ability
    to get along with other people or their possibilities。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: for advancement？ So those matter？ Yeah， they probably do as well。 Okay。 Well。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: pick which one of these you want to optimize on because we can't optimize on
    two， at the same time。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So at the very beginning that begins to throw a little wrinkle on us here。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's one thing to predict when a ball bearing is going to shatter。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's another to try to predict who is going to be a good performer when we can't
    completely。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: define in an easy way what does it mean to be a good performer。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The second problem we're going to bump into and you've heard this from our colleague。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Sunny Tambi and Will Turat talking about tools like machine learning is they
    require a lot， of data。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And a lot of data means if you're a reasonably small employer， let's say 500
    employees or。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: something， you probably don't have enough employee transitions， enough quits
    to build。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a machine learning model。 Even if you extend back historically over time and
    that becomes a problem because as we'll。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: see a little later questions about privacy start to come up。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: How long should we keep employment data？ Somebody who left 10 years ago， for
    example。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: raises interesting questions about privacy。 The other thing about data science。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: once we roll out a technique， data science like hiring。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and we're using it across the whole organization， if we make mistakes， the mistakes
    are easy。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to spot because they're happening now at scale。 Something else to think about。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the risk tolerance of making a one size fits all approach。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It might be much better than what we're doing before but if you make a mistake，
    easy to spot。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And if it breaks the law， easy for plaintiff lawyers to spot as well。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the big issues for us to think about is that when we introduce machine

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: those decisions away from somebody else。 And typically we're taking them away
    from supervisors。
  prefs: []

- en: So what happens when we make that transition？ So here's a quick example。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let's say right now we have to set a schedule for our employees who comes in
    on what days。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and at what times， let's say， right？ So we get the employees together and we
    talk this through。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we maybe set up a system and， the supervisors there a little， we do a bunch
    of negotiation。
  prefs: []

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: let's optimize this and go to scheduling software。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We make sure we get exactly the right number of people at the right time and
    we spread the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: workout completely evenly。 What happens now？ Well。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: let's say I'm an employee and I'm scheduled to work this Saturday， which I don't
    particularly， like。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And next Saturday， the schedule comes out and I'm scheduled to work next Saturday
    as well。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And I'm really angry about this。 The current system I go to my supervisor and
    complain to him about it and say。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: this is， terrible， can you do something about it？ And she might say back to
    me。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I understand this is really a problem。 I'll take care of it later on。 We won't
    do this to you again。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We replace that with the scheduling software and I get scheduled on Saturday，
    not happy， about it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Next Saturday， I get scheduled again。 I go to my supervisor and say， hey， what's
    going on here？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And my supervisor says， here's the software。 It did it。 This is terrible。 And
    my supervisor says。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: here's the phone number of the programmer who made the software。 Why don't you
    talk to them？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So we got a problem now of fairness and equity and we don't have a good way
    to solve it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So one of the big decisions we have to make about data science is where can
    we introduce。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    make things， worse。

    this program。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    to get out of the end of this program。
