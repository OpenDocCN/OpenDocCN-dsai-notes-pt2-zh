 Here， it's helpful to compare the kind of problems where we're using machine learning。

 like who's going to leave， with the kind of problems where machine learning actually。

 does much better。 So while the excitement is there about machine learning。

 there have been a bunch of applications， where this is really revolutionized performance。

 I think probably the best example is speech recognition。

 So actually when I was preparing to record these videos， I wrote up a bunch of my notes。

 actually using the kind of speech recognition in my computer。 I know what you're thinking。

 You're thinking he had notes。 But anyway， when I was doing this。

 I was dictating into the computer and it was frankly almost， flawless。

 It was pretty much as good as if I've been dictating it to a human。

 I've been playing around with speech recognition software for over 25 years。

 It never used to be anywhere near that good。 You know， it used to make a mistake every 10 words。

 Now it makes a mistake every 100 words。 Right。 This really is 99% plus accuracy。 Right。

 Same kind of machine learning algorithms that Sonny was talking about。

 So why is this so different to a nutrition prediction？ Well。

 I think part of it is that in one case speech recognition， you're taking something。

 that's already happened。 I said a word and then you're trying to classify it into category。

 So which word was it？ Somewhat different to predicting the future。

 Partly because when you're doing that kind of classification task， you kind of have all。

 the information necessary。 So when you're doing speech recognition。

 I say a word and then the computer tries to， classify it。 So let's take a look。 Let's say turtle。

 I don't know why。 Sounds like a nice word。 Say turtle。 Small amphibious creatures like pizza。

 according to some accounts。 Okay。 So when I say turtle， okay， what do we need to classify it？

 We need the sound file。 So we need the data of kind of the sound waves I made with my voice。

 We need also to know which language I'm speaking。 In some sense， with longer sentences。

 often it's useful to have the context for each of， the words around it。 But actually， in this case。

 just one word， turtle， usually the computer does a pretty， good job of recognizing it。

 It really has all the data necessary to do so。 Now let's think about an attrition prediction。 Okay。

 What do we need to make a really accurate attrition prediction？ So， you know。

 we've discussed a lot of data that will be helpful here。 So demographics。

 knowing how long they've been in the job， knowing what the job is， knowing。

 their performance evaluations， what job applications they're making， posts on social， media。

 those sorts of things。 So we can put all that in。 Do we think that's everything that we need to know to make a fully accurate prediction。

 of where they'll stay or leave？ No。 I mean， we can think of all sorts of other information that also might influence where。

 they stay or leave。 So， you know， what else might we want to know？

 Are they going to have a fight with their manager in the next month？ Okay。

 Do they have a plan to return to school that they haven't told us about？ You know。

 will they be offered a better job？ We don't have that in our model。

 Will the better job be better paid， better commute， better for their careers？ That would explain it。

 Even holding all those things constant， other things can matter。 So， for example。

 might they have to leave for reasons of ill health？ We don't have that in our model。

 Might they decide to leave work to look after a family member or maybe relocate because they。

 want to follow their partner or be nearer to the family？ What else could leave them to leave？ Well。

 you know， maybe they've always wanted to set up their own company and it turns out。

 that now's the right time to do it。 Maybe a friend always wanted to set up their company。

 They've done it and now this person's gone to join them。 There are some personality factors there。

 So even holding all those sorts of things constant， we can imagine that somebody who's。

 easily bored and likes changing their lives is going to be more likely to leave。

 Somebody who's really risk averse is going to be less likely to leave。

 Maybe even holding all these things constant。 We don't know everything。

 Maybe they're secretly in love with one of their colleagues。

 They're unable to consider working anywhere else without them and so they're not going， to leave。

 There are so many different things。 It's like human behaviour is complex。

 Kind of on the personality level， there are so many different aspects of their personality。

 that might affect decisions， we're unlikely to have measured out all of them。 But even beyond that。

 there are so many things outside the individual that shape their behaviour， what they behave。

 You might describe it as kind of an open system。 Even if I just perfectly understand you。

 that's not going to be enough because I also。

![](img/96e74fb10f254da9771a2c283337c6ff_5.png)

 need to understand your interactions with everybody else in the organisation。

 And then I also need to understand your interactions with all of the opportunities outside the。

 organisation。 There are so many things that go into whether or not you leave。 So many of them。

 we can't measure and we're never really going to measure。 It's not just whether you leave。

 So when we look at some of the other things， again， hiring， we're trying to predict performance。

 All of those external factors also shape your performance。

 So many things you'd like to know which you never can。 So without that data。

 with all of these different complex factors and interactions that shape， you。

 it becomes very hard to make very strong predictions。 Thank you。 [BLANK_AUDIO]。
