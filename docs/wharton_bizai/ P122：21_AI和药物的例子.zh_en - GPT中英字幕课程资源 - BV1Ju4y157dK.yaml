  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To what extent do AI can really help solving this really long complex innovation
    process？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    recombination。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    sweet spot。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    novelty in terms of how it's a structured。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: novel compared to all of these same chemical compounds out there。 And interestingly。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we find very similar things， even though it's not exactly the same measurement，
    of recombination。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: then we find that generally， AI is great at the middle range。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So AI is not great at finding really brand new chemical compounds that you haven't
    seen， before。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's effective for incremental but not as great。 But the biggest thing in the
    book is with an intermediate level。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: AI really can help you pharmaceutical firms finding drugs and intermediate level
    novelty。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    some kind。
  prefs: []

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: And remember， AI and analytics is really a pattern machine。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It finds all kinds of correlations and uses those correlations to make predictions。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But we all know that correlation is not causation。 And if you find the wrong
    correlation。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that means a $2 billion mistake in the drug industry。 So even though it can
    come up with many， many。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: many different possibilities of potential， chemical compounds in addressing
    a disease condition。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: many of that correlation could just， be spurious。 It may be wrong。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So how do we know which one's which？ Because the fact can be dramatic。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: AI could have a negative effect on drug innovation if a wrong target or wrong
    compound。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: was being picked for further development。 So we looked at this issue by classifying
    these drugs compound into do we know about。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the mechanism impact on how they target or treat a disease or if we don't know
    the mechanism。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So we look at AI's effect on these drugs or these new chemical compounds that
    we discovered。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: through AI。 So the first bar is the case is when no mechanism is being found。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So we don't know the mechanism impact on how this particular drug targets these。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But many drugs we know it works but we don't exactly know how。 If we do know
    exactly how。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: maybe it's easier to create drugs。 That's why we sometimes a lot of disease
    caused by virus is a very difficult treat because。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the mechanism shifting where we don't know exact mechanism。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We're bacteria we do know because we know how antibiotics kills bacteria。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In that case we do know what a mechanism is。 So look at the first bar when no
    mechanism is known you see that AI's effect is minimal。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's almost it's pretty much zero。 So AI does not help you find compound when
    you don't know the mechanism impact。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It makes sense because you're blind looking for correlation you don't know which
    one。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: correlation is right and whatever correlation you find may be spurious。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However if you do know the mechanism in the case of bacteria， halosine， when
    you find。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: one you know it will work。 You know why it will work。 Okay。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When you have the ability to verify because you have known the if you already
    know the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: mechanism and AI can have a great effect。 Okay。 But even with the known mechanisms
    you see that in terms of chemical novelty in like。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: three graphs， really the middle medium novelty that's driving the fact。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Even if you know the mechanism if it's really incremental effect， basically
    the chemical。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: compound is incremental improvement of existing one and its effect is relatively
    small。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Positive is relatively small。 And when it's very novel， very new， again the
    effect is almost zero。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And most of the fact that we've seen AI's effect on known mechanism come from
    drugs。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/006bb15ce7253576b943bef36a24c837_17.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: and it goes into intermediate novelty。 So the main takeaway is that it's really
    hard to know which drug candidates are real。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: which， ones are false。 Again， AI is a great data mining machine。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: finding all kinds of correlation and pattern， and hidden links you have never
    thought about before。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you've never seen before。 For example， a new way of combining things in a new
    way。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Or a way to link to a thing you haven't seen before。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But in terms of finding really novel drug compounds， that's just， you know，
    then the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: effect is relatively minimal。 But again， it's not saying that this new combining
    and new thing in a new way is not beneficial。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They're extremely beneficial。 This is how we find Hellesine potentially helping
    us address a next superbell problem。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is how we find a COVID-19 vaccine using AI。 That's because they're not
    necessarily radical。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There's because they're new way of combining things。 This still means this is
    extremely useful。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But the key here is to think about whether innovation is really a recombination
    innovation。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: whether you've already known the mechanism of how it affects the disease。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That mechanism impact really helps you to discern between spurious correlation
    and true， causation。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/006bb15ce7253576b943bef36a24c837_19.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: And the way we think about this novel innovation， really the first of this new
    type， right？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you think about it， right， as I mentioned before in our earlier study， we
    don't see。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in patent study。 We don't see AI's effects on this first of its kind innovation。
    Remember。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: indeed in a prior video， the first technology of his class。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And if you think about how AI can affect these class of innovation， in drug
    case， it's hard。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: because they're so new， they're very limited to data about that particular drug，
    about。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that particular condition。 And there's lots of tacit knowledge in the clinical
    experience of people。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: right？ And that's not exactly codifiable。 And it's very limited in terms of
    what AI and machine learning and data analysis can do。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to aggregate and detect patterns when this tacit knowledge cannot be used because
    it cannot。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: be codified。 If you think about breakthrough drugs， the novel therapy for malaria。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: this is discovered， by Dr。 Yu Yu 2。 She's a 2015 Nobel laureate， okay？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This drug come from a single line of ancient Chinese text， okay， combined with
    her clinical。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: expertise and deep understanding of malaria conditions。 This is how Dr。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Yu Yu 2 linked that single line of ancient text to the creation of the， first
    malaria drug therapy。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Again， in this case， AI really can't do much。 Limited data， even there's more
    than one line of data。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you know， AI's can't use that。 They need a lot more data than that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And lots of this clinical experience， tacit knowledge， just not codifiable for
    AI to use。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/006bb15ce7253576b943bef36a24c837_21.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: Maybe one day they are。 When they are ready to be used， maybe we can't make
    breakthrough。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but right now tacit knowledge， are not codifiable yet。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And they're very limited things we can do to use AI for this type of discovery。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So the main takeaway is that AI can help drug discovery at a very early stage
    and can't。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: mount discovery stage。 And the mechanism for doing that is that it can go through
    millions of compounded in a。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: very short amount of time。 I'm finding lots of correlation。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: lots of patterns that you haven't seen before。 And this pattern are critical
    to generate hypothesis about specific drugs。
  prefs: []

- en: '![](img/006bb15ce7253576b943bef36a24c837_23.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: And the fact is especially strong when you already know the mechanism impact
    that drug。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/006bb15ce7253576b943bef36a24c837_25.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: is。 Because that's a great way to verify if this drug works or not。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Before you go down a $2 billion path in clinical trials and figure out whether
    this thing works。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: or not in the clinical trial， then it is failing。 That is investment down the
    drain。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And we've seen that in general innovation using patent data， the AI really helps
    drug。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: discovery by finding the intermediate novel compound。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And that are pretty much similar to recombination innovation。 But for really
    novel drug therapy。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: by novel mean chemical novelty， it is still limited。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: use because there isn't data out there about that particular drug。
