  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it works well for very common roles。 We've got a lot of marketing analysts。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We've got a lot of controllers。 It's easy to see multiple routes in and out。

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in terms of entering those roles or leaving them。 The other challenges。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: this is all about what's happened in the past。 Jobs are changing very fast。
    Being able to tell you。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '"Well， in the past， people followed these routes。"， Well。'
  prefs: []

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: putting this data together。 In a fast-moving environment。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: just relying on prior roles might not be that effective。 A second approach，

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but also more tricky， is to draw career paths， based on skills。
  prefs: []

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that's not really an option for me。 If we can think about my skills and the
    skill demands of the jobs。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that's another way to， identify all of the various different possibilities for
    me in terms of my next movement。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are some nice ideas here， the idea that maybe I'm a market analyst and
    I hadn't really。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: thought that maybe I can move into HR as a data scientist， but actually the
    skills that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: are necessary are all the same。 When we look at skills。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we don't need to have this kind of lots of transitions that have， happened in
    the past。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It is really good for identifying new career paths that people haven't taken
    yet， paths。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in and out of new jobs。 This is a nice approach， it has its own problems though。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The particular barrier to using data on skills to identify career paths in the
    organization。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: is that often we don't have very good data on skills。 In order to do this。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we need to know what the skill demands are of different jobs and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we need to know what skills people actually possess。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That's the kind of core data that this and frankly a lot of workforce planning
    applications。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that organizations also want to engage in。 But where do we find that data？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Where do we actually find out what skills are people have？ Currently in most
    organizations。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
