- en: systems。 Recollect that in the last lecture we talked about certain challenges
    or trade-offs associated。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: with recommended design。 To recap that discussion。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: one of the main advantages of collaborative filtering is that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it does not require deep metadata about the products being recommended and therefore
    it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: is very easy to build。 At the same time it is quite effective and has been shown
    to help consumers discover。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: new products。 And it has a nice social appeal， for example。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: knowing that other people like me or consuming， certain songs increases my interest
    in that song as well。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However， there are some cons with this design。 We talked about how the collaborative
    filter design has a popularity bias and that is one。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: challenge especially if as a retailer you want to expose your customers to your
    back catalog。 Also。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: because these systems do not have deep knowledge about the products being recommended。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they cannot explain why certain products are being recommended to the users。
    And finally。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they also tend to have challenges with new users and new items。 In contrast。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: content based recommenders actually do not have a popularity bias。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They are also quite effective and also they have deep knowledge about the products
    being。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: recommended and they can explain the rationale behind the recommendations to
    consumers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But it is quite costly and expensive to build because you need detailed metadata
    about the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: products being recommended。 So the question that arises is whether there is
    a way to actually combine the two so that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you get the benefits of the two。 And this is a direction in which many companies
    have gone in recent years。

- en: One example is Spotify。 So for those of you who are used to using Spotify。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you are quite familiar perhaps with the Spotify， Discover Weekly recommendations
    where Spotify curates set up songs for you to listen to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now Spotify's Discover Weekly started off initially as a collaborative filtering
    based， design。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So originally Spotify's recommenders were based purely on collaborative filtering。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But over time it has combined content based recommender design principles as
    well。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now in order to do content based recommendations， one needs very rich metadata
    about the musical。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: qualities of songs。 This is expensive to gather if you are going to do it the
    way Pandora did it when it originally。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: started its service。 Meaning have artists listen to songs and rate these songs。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So an alternative is to use machine learning to automatically extract the attributes
    of， songs。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Spotify does this in two ways。 Just Spotify crawls the web to look at blog posts
    or any online discussions of songs。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And looks at the kinds of descriptive language people use when they discuss
    or describe songs。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And it uses those descriptive words as attributes of the song。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now this is very useful for songs that have been out there for a while and that
    are discussed。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: quite heavily。 Now new songs or niche songs represent a challenge because they
    are not discussed as much online。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To address that， Spotify uses machine learning to analyze the audio signal of
    each of the， song。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And it is now able to extract the number of musical qualities such as the tempo
    of the， songs。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: whether the song has major key tonality or not， how loud is the song， how much
    instrumentation。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: is there in the song and so on。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/494a230c5fc025f0c47431c430a69940_5.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: Ultimately， Spotify can use all of these content attributes that it extracts
    using。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: machine learning and pair it with collaborative filtering type of features looking
    at what。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: other people are consuming and therefore combine the best of the two worlds。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is also a direction in which Netflix is gone and many of the major media
    companies。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and online companies have gone in the direction of combining the best of both
    these different。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: recommendation designs。 Now of course， we've spent a lot of time talking about
    product recommendations。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: mostly because， they are very pervasive and they had very significant value
    to both the retailer or the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: firm and the consumer as well。 But it's important to acknowledge that personalization
    is not just product recommendations。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It is also about customizing customer experience across the different channels
    where you interact。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: with customers that may be on your website， that may be on a mobile app， that
    may be on。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: an email or that may be at a store。 It's the ability to actually figure out
    how to provide a holistic integrated experience。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: for the customer and that's what personalization is all about。 So for example。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: companies today are even personalizing emails。 So an email is sent out to the
    customer database but some of the content in the email might。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: be populated in real time when a customer opens the email。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So the email might be sent in an HTML format meaning in the same format as a
    webpage and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: when a customer opens the email then a certain JavaScript might be called which
    looks at the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: customer's location where they opened the email and it might customize the image。
    For example。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: if the email is for a promotion for sales of jackets， the emails might be。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: personalized where if a customer opens it in a location where it's currently
    raining。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they might see a rain jacket where if a customer opens it in a location where
    it's currently。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: snowing， they might see an image for a snow jacket and this personalization
    is done on。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the fly at the time when a customer opens the email based on running script
    and being。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: able to look at the customer's past data。 Now having said all of this。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: personalization adds a lot of value to both consumers and， firms but it also
    poses certain risks。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of those risks is misapplication meaning when your recommendation or personalization。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: algorithm makes sweeping generalizations about the customer and makes very poor
    recommendations。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and this ultimately turns off the customer from personalization。 Another concern
    is data privacy。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Consumer sensitivity to privacy is increasing significantly especially given
    how much information。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: companies have about customers and also because of rampant abuse of customer
    data by certain。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: companies and so it's very important for companies to be careful about how they
    use。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: data and the way they present personalization results because it's easy to cross
    a line that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: appears creepy to consumers。 And lastly， another risk with excessive personalization
    based on very sensitive consumer data is that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: regulators might step in and indeed in many jurisdictions regulators are stepping
    in and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: releasing a number of different data privacy regulations and so regulatory compliance
    also。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: imposes a certain new burden on companies as they start to do more and more
    personalization。

    and。
  prefs: []
