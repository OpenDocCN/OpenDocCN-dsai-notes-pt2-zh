- en: This is a term you're likely to run into when working with data scientists。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And it's a term that's useful to understand。 But before we go into MLOps。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it's useful to talk about DevOps or developer operations。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: which is a term that has been around and used quite frequently in the world
    of software。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: development。 ML DevOps refers to practices and tools that developers used to
    build， test。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and deploy， code in production。 Any time a developer makes changes to a very
    large and complex code base。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the fear is that， these changes could cause problems in the code and cause the
    software to fail in unexpected。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: ways。 So we need a more systematic approach to make changes to software。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One that involves creating a new branch of code， make changes to that branch
    without。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: touching the production code， and then testing the software using automated
    tests before。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: merging the code back with the main code and finally pushing it into production。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now there are two main components of traditional DevOps。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One is called continuous integration and the other is called continuous deployment
    or CI/CD。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: for short。 CI refers to the practice of creating branches of your main code。
    You make your changes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you push it in， you test it， and eventually you merge the changes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Continuous deployment or CD refers to the tests that are run before the code
    is finally pushed。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: into production。 And so this is the standard CI/CD pipeline。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now the development of machine learning models also requires careful attention
    to details。 However。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: there are some key differences from traditional developer operations。 In a machine
    learning system。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the code is not the only source of changes。 As the underlying data that is used
    to train and validate a model might change over time。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the machine learning model itself might change as it constantly retrains。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: And in any machine learning system， also the outputs of the machine learning
    model might。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: also need to be validated and checked for quality。 This is because as the model
    is evolving。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we do not know beforehand what are the correct， outputs of the system for all
    different cases。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And therefore we need attention to detail。

- en: There are a number of tools in the marketplace that are used by data scientists
    and developers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: for MLOps。 They serve a wide range of functions。 They include tools for managing
    the hardware infrastructure for machine learning。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Machine learning typically requires some customized hardware such as different
    kinds of processors。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: known as GPUs to do the machine learning。 There are tools to manage that kind
    of infrastructure。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are tools for data management。 There are tools for managing the models
    themselves。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Tools for deploying these models into productions。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And tools to monitor the behavior of the AI models， meaning monitor the outputs
    of AI models。

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: there are a number of tools out there。 For example。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Amazon is a tool called SageMaker that takes care of a number of these functions。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of MLOps that I mentioned。 Tools like paper space and a few others out there
    as well。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And there are also specialized tools。 For example。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: PackyDerm is a tool that specializes in data management and model management。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
