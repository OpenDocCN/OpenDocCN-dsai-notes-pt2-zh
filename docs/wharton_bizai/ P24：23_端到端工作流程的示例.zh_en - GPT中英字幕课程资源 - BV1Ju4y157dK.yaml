- en: Let's walk through a quick end-to-end example that brings some of these concepts
    together。

- en: Let's talk about a case we've talked about before， which is using machine learning
    or。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: deep learning in particular to identify a particular condition using medical
    images。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So step one in this case would be to collect large amounts of data on medical
    diagnostic。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: images with expert decisions that were made using those images。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So imagine if you had a database of a lot of x-rays and radiology decisions
    about what。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to do in terms of treatment given those images。 So going to a hospital and getting
    a database like that would be a great place to start to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: produce perhaps years and years of data on medical diagnostic images and decisions
    that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: were eventually made by radiologists on whether or not a person should receive
    a particular。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: kind of treatment or not。 So that's step one。 Step two is note that these experts。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: radiologists in this case， have labeled these images as。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: whether or not a patient has a condition or not。 So we have a database that
    is of the right general structure that we need for this kind。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of prediction task。 We have a lot of image data。 We have a lot of decisions
    that have been made。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So we can now use this data to build an algorithm and we can evaluate performance
    on， the algorithm。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So what we'll do is take this data。 We might split it up into a training sample
    and a test sample。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the training sample， we can use that image data to feed into a deep learning
    engine and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we can give it the labels created by the radiologists。 The deep learning engine。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the neural network will then basically run to configure itself。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: such that it can make the most accurate predictions possible in a way that matches
    up with the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: decisions that were made by the radiologist and we can use the test data to
    ensure at。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: various points that the algorithm we're building is performing not just well
    on the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: training data but also on other out of sample data sets that we might have access
    to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The machine can be then taught to predict relative accuracy given a medical
    image whether。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: or not someone has a condition。 So just by going through these few steps。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: take getting the database from say a hospital。 It has the right structure。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's got image data and it's got decisions made by experts。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We divide it up into training and test data。 We use the training data to make
    predictions。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We use the test data to ensure that it's still working on out of sample data。
    When it works well。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we can then deploy it and we can have this algorithm taking in images。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and making predictions or recommendations relatively high degrees of accuracy
    on whether。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: or not somebody has a condition。 Now a key point here is we never at any point
    in this process had to ask anyone to sit down。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and describe what aspects of medical images suggest a condition。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We didn't need that medical expertise。 It was implicitly contained in the database
    in those labels but we didn't have to ask。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: anyone to sit down and explain in great detail exactly what a condition would
    look like on。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: an x-ray or how we should identify it or how we should determine using an image
    whether。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: or not somebody had a condition。 There was never any need to talk to a medical
    expert or a radiologist。

  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: This is really the magic of machine learning is that data and computation are
    going to end。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: up substituting for a number of different kinds of expertise。 When we do things
    this way。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: there are a number of advantages。 One is consistency。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you think about algorithmic decisions relative to decisions that are delivered
    by humans。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: algorithms can deliver decisions that are consistent。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It doesn't matter if it's at the end of a busy day or at the beginning or in
    the morning。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's going to be consistent。 There are obviously scale and speed implications
    as well because an algorithm that's trained。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to make a decision accurately can be scaled up to making a lot of decisions
    relatively， accurately。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It works really well for some types of tasks。

    some of the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: deep learning tools that are now emerging and given the fact that with deep
    learning you。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: can take raw unstructured data that's labeled and the machine learning algorithm
    will do， the rest。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it can actually be a bit faster and cheaper to build these solutions out than。
