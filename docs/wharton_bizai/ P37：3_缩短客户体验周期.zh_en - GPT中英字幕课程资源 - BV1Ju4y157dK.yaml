- en: '![](img/a7f1bbaa9318ecaf53611797f8eec537_1.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: especially from the point of view of what can AI do for。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: either predicting the customer journey or making it shorter。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let's take some examples and better understand how technology， machine learning，
    AI。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: all the things that we talked about in the previous modules can help us in。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: understanding the customer journey。 Let's start talking about predicting the
    customer journey。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So these are very common examples。 So for example， the Amazon one， when you
    go on your Amazon page。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: if you let's say you're an Amazon Prime customer， you'd probably see， for， example。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: lots of things that are popular purchases or based on what you have， purchased
    in the past。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Amazon might make a recommendation of what you just purchased next。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/a7f1bbaa9318ecaf53611797f8eec537_3.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: So that's an example of if somebody has purchased some things in the past。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Amazon and all the algorithm behind Amazon are trying to predict。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: what would their customer journey look like in the future？ The same example
    perhaps is from Netflix。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And of course， if you have a Netflix subscription。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you have gone to your page and your page might be different from my page。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/a7f1bbaa9318ecaf53611797f8eec537_5.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: Why？ Because based on what you're viewing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/a7f1bbaa9318ecaf53611797f8eec537_7.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: Netflix using its algorithms is making a recommendation of what might be。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: some things that you might be interested in seeing in the future。 And of course。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that algorithm is personalized， so to speak。 Based on what somebody is watching。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the algorithm might decide what might be， some things that they might be interested
    in looking at in the future。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The same example might be a company called Stitch Fix。 Now here， it's a company。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it's a subscription company， which basically， offers different client with clothing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now they would like to know， for instance， if let's say Raghu is a subscriber，
    of Stitch Fix。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: what would they like to know？ Given the clothes that Raghu has had。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: what would he like to purchase next？ So in all of these examples， what's the
    idea here？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In all of these examples， the way algorithms， the machine learning。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: all of that stuff behind the scenes， what is it trying to do？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Looking at what you have purchased so far， where would you go next？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So this is all about predicting the customer journey。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let's take another example of what machine learning AI can do in terms of making
    the journey。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: shorter。 So an example might be all the different kinds of apps that you have
    these days。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: where you can take a picture and the app tells you what the product is。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So there are many examples of this。 So for example， there was an app called
    Snap Find Shop。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now what was the idea of that app？ The idea was the company that was releasing
    it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you could perhaps take pictures of someone's shoes， let's say you found them
    very nice。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you want to find out what the shoes are。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/a7f1bbaa9318ecaf53611797f8eec537_9.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: the app will open up and it will tell you if the shoes were obviously from that
    company。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: if not they would recommend something else。 What's the idea here？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Think back to the customer journey that we were talking about in a previous
    module。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Where we talked about the fact that once you have awareness， then you start
    thinking about。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: consideration， you start thinking about choice and perhaps start thinking about
    where to purchase it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What is this app trying to do using Vision AI？ What it's trying to do basically
    is making that journey shorter。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As soon as you take a picture， the vision algorithm， so to speak， the Vision
    AI is trying。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to figure out what is that picture。 In this case it happens to be a shoe。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It will start recommending where you can buy it。 So what is it trying to do？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What it's trying to do in some sense is making that journey between awareness
    and final purchase。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: as short as it can be。 This way of course， the company can then try to in some
    sense in a world of competition。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: because you might be then looking at that particular app， looking at those shoes
    that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the company is recommending and not look elsewhere。 There are many other examples。
    For instance。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the virtual fitting doing that I was talking about is very similar to this。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You can imagine that when you're thinking about buying certain kinds of products
    on the internet。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you know， pants， dresses， so on， anything that's more experiential。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now you might end up going to a fitting room， looking at those things， but if
    you're at home。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you still want to purchase， but you want to reduce for example the fact that，
    you know， you get it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it doesn't fit very well， you have to return it。 If you want to reduce the hassle
    cost。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that's where some of these companies are coming in。 So style。me， Sugara， Magic
    Mirror。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: there are many examples of these companies。 What they're trying to do is find
    the best fit。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So again， using Vision AI， what are they trying to do？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They're trying to figure out what is a way in which they can reduce quote unquote
    the time that you。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: take by going to an actual fitting room， perhaps trying out different types
    of clothes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This way they are again reducing that journey。 So the whole idea here by looking
    at some of these applications。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: which are broadly around Vision AI， the idea is how can I as a company by offering
    good technology be able to make that journey shorter？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Examples also come from B2B companies。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/a7f1bbaa9318ecaf53611797f8eec537_11.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: Now there are many chat bots， for example， language AI in this case。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: which are allowing businesses to talk to customers from other businesses as
    well。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/a7f1bbaa9318ecaf53611797f8eec537_13.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: So this way， you know， in some sense， if you're a business， you want to quickly
    transact。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: from other businesses， lots of examples of where language AI chat bots in this
    case are helping our。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: businesses。 There are many other examples where Google， for instance。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the Google Glass as an example， or other kinds of visual software is helping
    out in different factory floors。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: where， for example， a person does not need to carry big manuals。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What they can do in some sense is have Google Glass or。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: any other software of that kind and be able to see exactly what needs to be
    done。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So here's another example of how journey can be made shorter from a business
    point of view。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Of course， a classic example of how journey can be made shorter from a voice
    AI perspective again。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: is， for example， Amazon Echo and Google Home。 So think about what they do。 For
    instance。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/a7f1bbaa9318ecaf53611797f8eec537_15.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: some of us who may have Amazon Alexa at home， you can ask Alexa， for example，
    play different songs。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And of course， what you can also do is to start making your grocery list， you
    can do all of that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Similarly at Google Home， you can ask Google Home， for example， to search for
    restaurants nearby。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and perhaps even try to make a reservation。 So what are they trying to do these
    applications？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What they're trying to do is as soon as you have awareness of a particular need。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they're trying to in some sense use voice AI in this case to then be able to
    say。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: how can we make the journey shorter from the point of view of awareness to final
    purchase？ So again。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: just to sum up， when you start thinking about different kinds of applications，
    as we saw here。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we saw voice AI application， the language AI application and a vision AI application。
    But of course。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: what I wanted to focus on is not just the application itself。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's exactly what is it doing when you start thinking about the customer journey。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So two things that we've seen thus far。 One is making sure that we can understand
    what。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the customer journey is like and be able to predict it。 So that's predicting
    the next steps in the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: customer journey and machine learning algorithms help in that。 The other set
    of examples that we。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: just saw was making the journey shorter， which is as soon as a company understands
    that there's an。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: awareness of a need， how can we make sure that we can satisfy that particular
    need。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now going forward， we'll also look at other kinds of customer journey and what
    AI can do。
