  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    management。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So as Peter has described， managing people is complicated。 People have free
    will。 Not。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: only do we need to hire them， we need to motivate them。 We need to persuade
    them to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: do the things that we want them to do。 And they very much react to the ways
    that we manage， them。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So figuring out how to manage them appropriately is key to running a successful，
    organisation。 Now。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: artificial intelligence and machine learning can create new opportunities to
    find better。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: ways to manage people。 Before we get into that though， I think it's actually
    useful just。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to say a little bit about how organisations have been managing people so far。
    After all， before AI。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: organisations had all these problems and they were thinking very seriously about。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: what they could do to get the best out of their employees。 Now， clearly， in
    order to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: really get into how organisations manage people， that's 10 hours。 I want to
    spend 10 minutes， okay。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but just very briefly go through how organisations thought about some of the
    main。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: challenges that they face and try to address these。 I want to talk about three
    in particular。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that are critical to organisations and we're really going to focus on over the
    course of。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: these videos。 So talk a little bit about hiring， a little bit about managing
    workers' engagement。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and a little bit about attrition。 So let's talk about hiring。 Hiring is a really
    fundamental。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: process in managing people。 After all， if you bring the right people into your
    organisation。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you don't need to worry so much about training them， they're more likely to
    do the job well。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: hopefully they're even going to be more engaged。 If you hire the wrong people，
    either they stay。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: into a terrible job or they leave immediately and you have to hire all over
    again。 Either。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: way being able to figure out how to hire successfully is really important to
    organisations。 Peter's。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: going to spend a bunch of time discussing how AI can be applied in this area。
    I want to spend。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a little bit of time before then， just talk about， you know， what are the conventional。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: ways in which organisations hire people。 And I think it's fair to characterise
    it in some。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: ways kind of a tug of war between very structured processes for figuring out
    who has the most。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: potential and managerial discretion around how to hire with kind of a side order
    of cost， control。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let me talk a little bit about each of these。 So first of all， the structure
    process。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So we can think about hiring。 In some ways there's a measurement problem， right？
    A lot。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of AI is about data， how we measure things。 Here in any kind of hiring， what
    we're really。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: trying to measure is applicants' potential。 We're trying to figure， if we bring
    them in。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: as employees， how good do we expect them to be？ Now， there's been basically
    a century。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of research by psychologists into this question， trying to figure out how we
    can assess people。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and predict their potential in different jobs。 And this is given rise to a bunch
    of best。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: practices that organisations try to employ。 We kind of know that three things
    are pretty。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: good when it comes to predicting performance。 So first of all， and most importantly，
    it's。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: what we call structured interviews。 What's a structured interview？ It's when
    organisations。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: first figure out what attributes of people are most important to do the job。
    Then they。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: work out what kind of questions can we use that will actually assess whether
    people have。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: those attributes and they define a set of questions they're going to ask every
    candidate。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And then they also have a rubric。 So for the answer to each question， they define
    beforehand。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: what's a poor answer， a medium answer and a good answer。 And they run every
    candidate。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: through this and score them accordingly。 So structured interviews， very good。
    In some， settings。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: tests of cognitive ability， broader job knowledge tests can do a good job of
    figuring。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: out who has the abilities necessary to do the job。 And you know， some evidence
    that personality。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: tests can also be effective。 And so HR departments will kind of adopt these
    practices and try。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and use them to do a structured assessment of people to figure out who has the
    most potential。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to perform well in the organisation。 They'll also try and avoid the things that
    we know。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: tend not to work so well， in particularly unstructured interviews。 That is interviews。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: where we basically just sit down with people， ask them a few of our favourite
    questions。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: have a back and forth and try and get a good feel for them。 So that's the kind
    of the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: structured process sides of hiring。 The other side I said was managerial discretion。
    What。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: do I mean by that？ Well， the HR department can put all of these nice structured
    processes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: into place。 But at the end of the day， in most organisations， the HR department
    is not actually。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: doing most of the hiring。 You know， for some high-volume entry level roles，
    and it might。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: go through a structured recruitment process。 But most of the time new hires
    are actually。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: being hired by what we call hiring managers， the kind of frontline managers
    for whom they're。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: going to work。 So what this means is that even though the HR department might
    have all these。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: structured processes， they're used to depends on whether or not the managers
    involve， actually。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: want to apply them。 And often it seems they don't。 And so we often find that
    managers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: resist these structured processes， partly because they find it very stiff and
    formal。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They like getting the way of kind of a smooth interaction with people when you're
    kind of。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: following down a set rubric on a questionnaire。 But also I think because we
    tend to believe。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we're very good judges of character。 We're not。 But we tend to believe that
    we really。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: know what people are like。 We form opinions of them quickly and then we spend
    most of。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: our time trying to justify those decisions。 And so if you believe you're a great
    judge。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of character， why would I need to follow this very structured process when instead
    I can。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: just chat with them。 So we find a lot of managers may not follow these processes
    and instead。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: basically just prefer to ask people what their spirit animal is and take it
    from there。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The third piece that I mentioned about hiring is in addition to this kind of
    back and forth。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: between structured processes trying to get people to follow them。 There are
    also elements。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of cross control。 You want to hire the right people， but you also want to do
    it efficiently。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so organizations are also spending a lot of time worrying about kind of
    their costs， per hire。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So how much are we spending in terms of external spend on advertisement and
    recruiters？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: How much are we spending internally？ The time of our recruiters and so on in
    order to bring。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in each hire。 Is that too much？ How do we bring it down？ They may also worry
    a lot about。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: how long it's taking to fill the job， track time to fill the job because the
    longer it's。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: filled the job， the longer it's staying empty and the more disruption that's
    going to cause。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so we kind of look at these as well and try to figure out how do we get
    our hiring done。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: properly。 I think Peter will discuss a little bit。 There can be a challenge
    there when inputs。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: are easy to measure and outputs are hard。 Maybe we focus too much on cross-by-hire
    and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: not enough on quality。 Some organizations will also try and figure out are we
    doing a good。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: job of this。 So for example， you might serve a supervisors after three months
    or six months。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and say， "Okay， we hired this person。 Would you hire them again？" You might
    also look。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: at attrition after three months or six months。 So using these not only do we
    try and get the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: right people hired， but we can also start to look at the overall structure of
    our hiring。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: process and get a sense， is it doing the things that it's intended to？ And through
    the use。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of all of these levers， organizations really try and make sure they hire the
    right people。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/c52106a36383121db265bf0574891de1_3.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: effectively。 A second area of people management that we're going to talk about
    in this course。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: is engagement。 You know， again， coming back to this fundamental issue of people
    have free， will。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So we need to motivate them to do the sorts of things that we want them to do
    to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: make this organization successful。 Now， there are lots of levers that we can
    pull around。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: motivation。 A big one is kind of job design and structuring the exact tasks
    that people， can do。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The culture of the organization and the way that people are led also helps to
    define。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: their relationship with it and how excited they feel about coming to work every
    day。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So there are lots of things we can do。 Fundamental getting it right though is
    actually knowing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: how engaged people are in the first place。 And so organizations spend a certain
    amount。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of time and effort trying to figure out are our people engaged？ How do they
    feel about， this？ Now。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: obviously it's not always easy to know what people are thinking and feeling。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So the standard way that we try to do this often is through employee engagement
    surveys。 Okay。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I'm not sure how many of you have taken these surveys， but basically a lot of
    companies。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: will pretty much every year send out a long survey to their employees who are
    lastly。 How。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: do you feel about working here？ What do you like about your job？ What are some
    of the downsides？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: How do you feel about your manager？ What's your opinion about your pay， your
    benefits， the company。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: all of these sorts of things？ Often they tend to use very specific sets of questions。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: developed by psychologists that will really enable them to clearly tap into
    specific opinions。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: about each of the attributes that they might care about in their work。 Okay，
    why do this？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: First of all， it gives us a good sense of how we're doing overall or are people
    excited？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When you do it from one year to the next， you can start to examine trends， right？
    Are we。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: getting better？ Are we getting worse？ Even more importantly， you can look across
    different， groups。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What are the parts of the organization where people are engaged？ Where are the
    departments。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: where they're disengaged？ What can we do about that？ Generally， these engagement
    surveys are。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: reasonably effective。 If you want to know how engaged people are， you can do
    a lot worse。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: than just asking them。 That said， there can be some problems。 Something I'll
    come back。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to a couple of times， isn't it？ There's obviously a gap between what people
    are thinking and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: what they tell you they're thinking。 For example， people might not always tell
    the truth。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I remember， back in my labour economics class， one of the things that I really
    picked up was that if。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: anybody from your company ever asks you， "Are you paid enough？" The answer is
    just always， no。 No。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I'd like to be paid more。 People may be a little strategic about trying to make，
    out。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Things aren't great in the hope that people improve things for them。 On the
    other， hand。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they can be worries about retaliation。 If I'm in a small group and people are
    asking。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: me about my manager， am I sure that my saying my manager's terrible is not going
    to get。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: back to her and then get back to me。 You have to be a little careful。 The other
    challenge。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: with these surveys is also that they're expensive。 If you're getting everybody
    in your company。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to fill out a survey， that's an awful lot of person hours that are going into
    that。 Even。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: just the effort to make sure people fill it in is not on trivial。 To avoid those
    expenses。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a lot of organisations will therefore only do this once a year。 Which， again，
    if you want。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: an overall sense of how we're doing， it's not a terrible idea。 But if what you're
    trying。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to get is an early warning sign of problems， you're only getting that once a
    year。 When。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: things are changing very rapidly， and this happened recently during the pandemic，
    you。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: don't want to wait until next year to figure out what's going on。 That kind
    of the long。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: time between it and the cost of doing this turned out to be quite a challenge
    when doing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: these engagement surveys。 A third area that I'm going to talk about， a reasonable
    amount。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: during this course， is attrition。 People leaving turnover。 There are different
    ways that we。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: can describe it。 Why do we spend so much time talking about it？ But I really
    care about。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it because it's a major source of cost for them。 I've just mentioned it's really
    important。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to hire the right people。 Well， if I hire the right people， but then they leave，
    I've got。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a guy out and hire all over again。 There's a high cost of just replacing people。
    But I。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: think even more than that， there's a lot of disruption that comes from turnover。
    The。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: people who work with the person who's left， they've got to build new relationships
    with。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the people they have to work with now。 People who come in to replace them， they
    don't understand。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the organization。 They don't know those people。 It takes them a long time to
    get up to speed。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There may even be some very specific knowledge about our products， about our
    clients。 There。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: are other people in the organization don't have and walks out the door when
    people leave。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so attrition tends to be very costly in organizations， and they spend a
    lot of time。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: thinking about what can we do to drive that down。 Now， again， there are a lot
    of levers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that potentially we can pull to address attrition。 We can think about who we
    hire。 Are we hiring。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: people who are likely to stay？ We can think about our pay package。 If we pay
    more， hopefully。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: people will stay more。 We can think about all the things that drive engagement。
    If we have。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: better leadership， better design jobs and so on， will people say， "There are
    a lot of。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: levers that we can pull？" So one of the questions we want to know is， "Which
    ones should we pull？"。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so then we need to figure out why are people leaving？ So broadly， I would
    say there。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: are two approaches that organizations have taken to this。 One is just figure
    out where attrition。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: is。 So organizations will traditionally track their attrition rates。 They're
    basically calculated。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: as the number of people who leave in a given period， maybe six months or a year，
    divided。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: by the number of people who you employed at the beginning of that period。 So
    that can。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: be a small number。 It can be a very big number。 In some areas， say， areas of
    retail， fast food。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and so on， that can be over 100%。 So again， when you track these attrition rates
    over time。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you can start to look at trends。 If it's edging up， can we do something about
    that？ Probably。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: more than that， by looking at where attrition is higher， which departments，
    which jobs。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: which groups， we again can start to get some idea of what might be driving it。
    Why would。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it be that this department leaves more？ And what does that tell us about what
    we need。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to do about it？ Even more direct， as a way of understanding why people are leaving，
    is。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: exit interviews。 So exit interviews are where people sit down with people who
    are leaving。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and ask them why they're leaving。 And you can get insight from this。 Maybe a
    lot of people。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/c52106a36383121db265bf0574891de1_5.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: are telling you they're leaving because they've got a better paid job。 Maybe
    people are telling。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you they're leaving because another role involves more career advancement。 Maybe
    they're leaving。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: because their new job has a shorter commute。 And by looking at what reasons
    come up systematically。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: organisations are able to start getting a sense of what they might need to do
    in order。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to reduce attrition。 Again， exit interviews are not perfect。 There are few limitations。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So one is you can't even get everybody to respond in an exit interview。 If some
    people。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: just abandon their job， which can happen a fair bit， you never get a chance
    to speak， to them。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Even more than that， there are big concerns that when people do these exit interviews。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a lot of what they're telling you is not what's true。 It's what they think you
    want， to hear。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so people may be reluctant to criticise others in the organisation， bring，
    up poor management。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: those sorts of things， because they don't know if they're ever going， to want
    to come back。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It may be more convenient to talk about money， whether or not that's。
