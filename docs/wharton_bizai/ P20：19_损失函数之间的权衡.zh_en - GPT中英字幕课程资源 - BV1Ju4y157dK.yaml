  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When might we want to prioritize certain types of metrics over others when evaluating
    machine learning output？

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: The key question really is what are the relative costs of false negatives and
    false positives in the particular application or business context that we're considering？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So， for example， when might we want a highly sensitive test？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So consider a medical application where the algorithm is screening for a very
    serious disease or a type of cancer。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For instance， when we want to make absolutely sure that we don't miss a person
    with the condition。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: even at the potential cost of falsely identifying some cases having the condition。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: even if they don't。 So if you want to be absolutely sure we don't miss anybody
    with the condition。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: then we might want a highly sensitive test。 We want to prioritize sensitivity
    in that case。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another example is， and this is part of the context with the science was actually
    developed during World War II。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: was when we have a radar system that's trying to detect incoming aircraft。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So if we're worried about incoming aircraft or enemy attack of some type and
    we want a system that's going to detect potential incoming aircraft。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we might want a highly sensitive test。 We don't mind a few false alarms。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but we want to make absolutely sure that we don't miss any cases that are actually
    occurring。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So that's another example where we might want a highly sensitive test。 On the
    other hand。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: one might be want a precise test。 One might want to say。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: be absolutely sure that something is the case before we say or predict it is
    the case。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Imagine you're developing an algorithm to predict when it's okay for a car to
    take a left turn。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now we might want to be absolutely sure that it is okay to take a left before
    recommending the decision to take a left。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Even if that means we'll possibly miss a few opportunities to take a left turn。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that's okay as long as we're absolutely sure when we predict the left or recommend
    the left that a left is actually okay。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So that's an example of a time you might want to prioritize precision。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another example of when precision might be something to prioritize is identifying
    some type of violation that has a very severe punishment。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So for example， cheating that leads to expulsion。 So we might want to be extremely
    sure that a particular person was guilty before we actually made that decision
    of an algorithmic sense。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/dfc525e35c82a2eceff6a2eb404a61cf_3.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: Even if it means that we might miss a few cases where that actual type of violation
    occurred。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we might want to have a very precise test just to make sure we don't falsely
    accuse someone of that crime or that violation when they didn't were not actually
    guilty of that violation。
