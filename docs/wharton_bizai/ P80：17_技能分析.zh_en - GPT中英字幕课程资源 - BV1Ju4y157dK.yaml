  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So a lot of organizations that are moving in this direction， that are trying
    to build。

  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: some of these applications that are based on the idea of really understanding
    their。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: employee skills， are now trying to figure out what can we do to actually measure
    skills。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: both of employees and the jobs they're moving into as inputs to those systems。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are broadly a couple of approaches that we can take to measuring skills。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So one approach to figuring out what skills people have is quite simply to ask
    them， okay。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you want to ask them to create a list of all the skills they possess， then you
    also。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: want to ask them to continue to update that profile as they continue to learn
    new things。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Makes sense。 One of the challenges here is getting people actually to fill up
    those profiles and keep。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: them up to date。 A couple of approaches that organizations have taken to try
    and actually get them to maintain。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: these skill profiles。 One is really trying to create strong incentives for people
    to report their skills。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So a number of organizations have looked to the outside world and said， you
    know， what's。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: really depressing is that LinkedIn has much better data on our employer skills
    than we。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: do ourselves and this usually leads to the thought of， but what if we create
    our own LinkedIn？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Maybe if we can create internal profiles， particularly if those profiles are
    useful for。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: getting jobs internally， people will fill in all their skill data on that as
    well。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: From what I've heard， these efforts haven't always worked terribly well。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I think often these kind of internal LinkedIn projects suffer from kind of a
    chicken and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: egg problem， right， which is I'm excited to fill in this profile if I know that
    recruiters。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: are going to look at it and recruiters are excited to look at these skill profiles
    if。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: everybody's filled them in。 But if neither side starts， then we never really
    get the ball rolling。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so these， I think， have been mixed success。 The second approach that some
    organizations have taken around measuring skills is just。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: making identifying their skills part of the formal performance appraisal process。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So each year I get my performance appraised， maybe I have to work on setting
    my goals for。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: next year。 And I have to report all of the skills that I have。 And what I've
    learned this year。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: those sorts of things。 Does it work？ Again， one of the challenges here is just
    getting employees to take the exercise seriously。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Some may do so。 Others it may just become a box checking exercise。 I mean。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I think this is a place where there can be some other uses for AI， so some organizations。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: have experimented with。 If we can suggest skills that they probably have。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: maybe that will help the process。 They can check the ones that they have and
    ignore the others。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You know， how can we do that？ We could maybe do it based on the kind of projects
    that they've worked on。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the job they're， in， what are the skills other people in the job have。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We could even start to look through documents and things that they've written
    over the year。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and use that to code kind of what are the skills that are likely if they've
    used that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So there are definitely applications for machine learning here， whether or not
    it's accurate。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: enough that we can rely on that or whether we need people to at least confirm
    its accuracy。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Still an open question。 Yeah， I think getting people to report their skills
    is definitely valuable。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but it does， require a lot of thoughtful work from employee base and kind of，
    yeah。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: decent compliance for。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/c31407b2b580215f34446a4fec328e57_3.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: them in keeping those skills up to date。 So if we can't get our employees to
    report their own skills。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: what else can we do？ Well， another way we can try and understand what skills
    people have had is to look at。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the jobs that they've had。 Okay， so one of the nice simplifying strategies basically
    to say， well。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: not only do skills， determine what jobs people will be able to do now。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but skills also determine what jobs， they've had in the past。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So I ought to be able to assume that any job that somebody's in， they either
    had the skills。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to do or required those skills during the job。 And so by looking at the series
    of jobs that people have been through in the past。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I get， a pretty good idea of what skills they ought to have。 Okay， obviously
    in order to do this。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we need to know what skills are associated with each， job。 How do we figure
    that out？ You know。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: again， there are multiple approaches。 So one is we can use existing databases。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: so the most common one here， something called， O-Starnet or O-net。 It's a government
    database。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They took about the 900 occupations， the kind of broad jobs that we see in the
    economy。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And for each occupation， they coded up a whole series of skills and abilities
    that people。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: are expected to have in those occupations。 Okay？ And so just by seeing what
    occupations we have in our organization and what occupations people。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: have moved between， we have some idea of what sort of skills they ought to have。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The nice thing here is it's very simple， all that data sitting there。 You know。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the challenge is it kind of assumes that every job within an occupation has
    the， same skills。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they don't。 And so there's clearly a lot of measurement error that goes into
    that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But it's still been a common approach for a lot of organizations just getting
    a first。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: cut at what kind of skills are present in our organization based on the jobs
    people are。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/c31407b2b580215f34446a4fec328e57_5.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: doing。 So a more accurate way to understand the skills required from each job
    is actually to go to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the descriptions of the jobs themselves within each organization。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So here's some organizations might actually do some formal job analysis， what
    they kind。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of bring in psychologists to figure out kind of for each job， exactly what it
    entails。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But it's a somewhat bureaucratic process。 And like all these things。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: those analyses can swiftly become out of date。 Make a more reliable source of
    information on these job analyses。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: actually kind of the， job requirements that are posted when jobs are being filled。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Because ultimately it's when we're hiring for jobs that probably companies think
    most。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: about what they require in those jobs， what people will be doing， and really
    codify it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so those job postings can be a nice source of data for understanding the
    skills that jobs。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: require。 Indeed， there are a number of firms， I'm most prominently a company
    called Burning Glass。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that have developed pretty sophisticated algorithms for going through job postings
    and actually。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: passing them and identifying all of the skills that those jobs require。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Sometimes those analyses are kind of cross-company and so I think Sonny and
    Peter will talk a。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: little bit about how AI is changing the broader labor market。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And a lot of the studies that have been done， look at that， have actually drawn
    unchanged。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and job postings as a way to understand changes skill demands。 Obviously though。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: these same approaches can be used inside organizations。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So we can look at all of the job postings inside the organization to understand
    what。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: are the skills and incumbents of those roles have been expected to possess。
    And therefore。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: what skills should we expect people who've been through those roles will， possess。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And we can use that then both to understand the demands of each role and the
    skills of。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/c31407b2b580215f34446a4fec328e57_7.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: people based on the jobs that they've been through。 As organizations have become
    more complex。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: just leaving people to figure out their careers， on their own has become more
    difficult。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We need to give them guidance， we need to help them understand the possibilities。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But also as organizations become more complex， helping them understand that
    has become harder。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So that's somewhere where AI tools have really been helpful， helping organizations
    understand。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the relationships between jobs， helping them understand where the skills are
    in the organization。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: helping them build paths that people can traverse if they want to build a career
    within that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: organization。 [BLANK_AUDIO]。
