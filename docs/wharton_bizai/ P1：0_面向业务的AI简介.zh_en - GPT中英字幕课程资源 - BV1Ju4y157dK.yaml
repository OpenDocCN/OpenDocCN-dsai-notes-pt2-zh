- en: In a research study by Goldfarb et al。 the researchers looked at whether artificial
    intelligence。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    Now research。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: related jobs are a particularly important indicator of a general purpose technology
    because they。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    jobs can。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    jobs related to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: machine learning。 Not every other technology showed this kind of widespread。
    In short， a number of。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: these statistics do suggest that machine learning in particular and AI in general
    is likely to be。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a general purpose technology。 There are many implications of this。 The first
    is that companies。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and managers need to realize that machine learning and AI will have significant

    also implies that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: managers need to be patient with the technology。 The transformative impact of
    the technology might。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: come with the lack。 Therefore， to effectively make use of these opportunities。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: managers will need to， understand the technology and its applications。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They will need to make many changes to their， business models， to their tech
    infrastructure。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
