- en: So in this module， we'll talk about something exciting。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is about how companies can move upstream in the customer journey。
  prefs: []

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: Now we talked about something predicting customer journey， making it shorter。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let's try to contrast this。 Let's take an example first to get started。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When you start thinking about search， perhaps Google is the first company that
    comes to your。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/89beca2c7572e13147c648a4b20a5b6b_3.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: mind。 But look at these numbers。 What they're suggesting is when people are
    searching for products to buy。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in fact if， anything， Amazon is much higher than Google。 And for prime users。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the difference between Amazon and Google is even higher。 What does that suggest？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What that suggests is that if you are an Amazon prime customer， when you go
    on the Amazon， website。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: what Amazon is able to do is not just recommend you products。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/89beca2c7572e13147c648a4b20a5b6b_5.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: Of course they can do that。 But what they're able to do is to curate your entire
    journey。 Which is。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: if you're thinking about buying a smartphone， you go on Amazon， looking at，
    your past purchases。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: looking at all the things that they know about you， they might be not。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: just able to recommend what smartphone you should be buying， but they might
    be able to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: quote unquote look at your entire customer journey of how you should go about
    buying， it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So that's the idea of moving upstream in the customer journey。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So let's revisit the example of Amazon Alexa and Google Home。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/89beca2c7572e13147c648a4b20a5b6b_7.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: So when I talked about this example， we had talked about Google Home and Amazon
    Alexa。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: shortening the customer journey。 Let's further this example a little bit in
    terms of how they own the customer journey。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So Amazon， for example， of course， also owns Whole Foods。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So let's think about an application on Amazon Alexa where you can in some sense
    make you。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: grocery lists。 Well， you can certainly make you grocery lists and keep that
    grocery list there。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that's fine。 But you can also in some sense at the end then decide that you
    would like to order from Whole。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Foods。 So what is this doing？ What this is doing is it's not just a way of shortening
    the customer journey。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it's entirely， curating that whole journey right from the awareness stage where
    you might start using。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Amazon Alexa to make your grocery list。 Then you go ahead and order from Alexa。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it will also make the purchase for you。 Similarly， with Google Home。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you can start searching for restaurants nearby， but you can， also make reservations
    on it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So that's the point I want to get across here with many other examples of how
    as a company。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you can then start thinking about not just shortening the customer journey or
    predicting。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the customer journey。 You can start thinking what I call owning the customer
    journey。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So I wanted to bring your attention to something called super apps。 So for example。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you might be comfortable going on your phone and going to a Facebook app。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a Twitter app perhaps or a Spotify app for instance。 Of course these are separate
    apps。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What that means is you go on Twitter， you go and look at what's happening on
    Twitter。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you come back out， you go on Facebook and so on and so forth， you're visiting
    different， apps。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But what's happening in many other countries as well is that there are many
    applications。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: which are called super apps which in some sense have become the landing page
    of where。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: everyone goes for a variety of different things。 So as an example， in Korea
    it's K-Talk。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in China it's VChat and so on and so forth， what， will these apps do？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Well they have become big portals。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/89beca2c7572e13147c648a4b20a5b6b_9.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: So for example in China you can use VChat to pay your peers money just like
    you would。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: use Venmo here for example in the US。 You can of course have the social network
    environment in there。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you can perhaps make， purchases， you can talk to other businesses。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: pretty much it's become the landing page。 Now you can imagine how different
    that experience is for a customer when using VChat or a K-Talk。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: as compared to perhaps using a Facebook or a Twitter。 Why？ Because in some sense
    what VChat。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: K-Talk and in India something called PTM， what are they， trying to do？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They are becoming in some sense the curators of your customer journey。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So that's what I mean by going upstream。 You are in some sense becoming the
    place where customers go when they start their journey。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let's take another example from the entertainment perspective。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And of course in the US you have many different streaming platforms。 So Roku
    is one of them。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Apple TVs and so on。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/89beca2c7572e13147c648a4b20a5b6b_11.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: Now when you start thinking about this why do I say that they are also in some
    sense。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: figuring out how to go upstream？ For those of us who might have used Roku for
    instance the way the platform is set up is。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that you have different tiles let's say you have Netflix， Amazon Prime， many
    other applications。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So what do you end up doing？ You end up thinking about what you want to watch。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You go to a Netflix tile and go down the Netflix streaming app。 Look for things。
    And so on。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Apple TV for example is an Amazon fire quite different。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There you end up looking at what you want to search for and they might show
    you all。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: different places where you can find it。 So look at the different ways in which
    in some sense by using either Roku。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Apple TV， Amazon， Firestick you're in some sense getting a very different experience
    the way they are curating。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: your customer journey is different。 Roku for example curates that journey by
    different streaming platforms。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You decide you want to access Netflix or Amazon Prime or something else Disney
    Plus for instance。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: whereas on Apple TV you start by thinking of the content that you want to watch。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So notice the two different ways in which you can go about it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And of course these two different ways have different implications of what the
    customer。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: journey would be like。 Let's think about healthcare。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Of course healthcare is very fragmented industry。 There are lots and lots of
    things going on in healthcare。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So I wanted to bring your attention to the idea of who owns the data and why
    do I bring。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: up the same companies that we've talked about before。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So the examples that I have on this page about Apple， about Amazon， about Google。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The same companies that we had talked about before are now making inroads into
    healthcare。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Of course for Apple it's a lot about what I call mobile technologies。 It's all
    about variables。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So the Apple watch that you wear， the phone that you have， of course it's becoming
    more。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and more compatible with a lot of different kinds of perhaps measurements that
    you want， to take。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So the Apple watch can perhaps look at what your heart rate is like and all
    of that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So technology is making healthcare more personalized as the Apple slogan says。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Similarly Amazon is getting into healthcare as well。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And Google for instance is looking at many other companies that are looking
    into for example。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: doing lots of early test studies and so on。 The big question here of course
    is whether you're going to Apple route。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Google route， Amazon， whatever the case might be， he's who owns the data。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What's going to be happening in terms of where the data lies and what kinds
    of applications。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: can be built on that data。 So again going back to the Apple example。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: clearly by looking at their phones， the watches that， they have， the apps that
    they have。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: how they're trying to in some sense make healthcare more， personalized。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Clearly if you buy into the Apple ecosystem you clearly might be in some sense
    locked into。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that ecosystem in terms of all the different facilities that they have。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So thinking about who owns the data becomes quite critical even in healthcare
    environment。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now let's also take an example of what I call upstream and then downstream。
    What is the idea here？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The idea here of course is we've taken many examples of how companies can go
    upstream which。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: is thinking about awareness， thinking about how they can shorten the journey，
    own that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: journey and so on。 But of course the journey doesn't stop once somebody purchases。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The journey continues， why？ because there are many other purchases that somebody
    can make。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For instance Casper company here in the US that basically gives mattresses for
    much lower， prices。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What does it want to be？ It wants to be what they call the Nike of sleep。 What's
    the idea here？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They want to in some sense own that particular vertical of quote unquote sleeping。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So they want to think about what other facilities can they offer， what other
    products can they。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: offer which is beyond mattresses as well。 So the nectar another competitor wants
    to expand their product line。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So the idea here is when you start thinking about the customer journey， you
    don't just。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: think about the initial part of the customer journey which is going upstream。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You also start thinking about what happens when that particular purchase is
    done。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Are there other things that you can also offer to that customer？ Let's take
    some another example。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/89beca2c7572e13147c648a4b20a5b6b_13.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: Airbnb。 Of course Airbnb is very very popular service to in some sense go ahead
    and you know if。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you want to take a vacation you can go ahead and either rent a room in somebody's
    house。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you can rent the entire house and so on。 But what Airbnb also realized is that
    when people take a vacation they're not just going。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: there to stay in somebody's apartment or a house。 They want to do many other
    activities。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So if you notice Brian Chesky who is one of the co-founders of Airbnb basically
    says for。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: every dollar you spend in a hotel you spend three dollars in that city。 Where
    you eat。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the entertainment， all you do all day。 They basically want to think of this
    as a long-term opportunity。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/89beca2c7572e13147c648a4b20a5b6b_15.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: So there's something called Airbnb experiences。 So if you go on Airbnb you can
    see like for example let's say you want to go to Philadelphia。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: or New York you can go ahead and see what other things are out there in that
    city as you start。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: traveling。 So that's where I talk about going upstream but also going downstream
    which is owning the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: customer journey not just from the point of view of just the initial choice
    but owning。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that entire experience。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/89beca2c7572e13147c648a4b20a5b6b_17.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: Let's take one more example。 This time from a B2B perspective， business to business
    perspective。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Shopify of course is a very big company which helps small and medium businesses
    go on the， web。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That's how they started。 In some sense you can think about you know the local
    mom and pop store wants to go on。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the internet how do they set it up。 Shopify made it easy。 So what did they start
    with？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They basically started out by offering services where you could in some sense
    you know put。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: your website very easily on the web， set up all the back end and so on so forth。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So you as a company owner did not really need to be tech savvy。 Shopify will
    handle it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Then they basically said once you've in some sense gotten people on the internet
    on the website。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/89beca2c7572e13147c648a4b20a5b6b_19.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: Well perhaps we can also start offering point of sale services。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/89beca2c7572e13147c648a4b20a5b6b_21.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: So Shopify started offering point of sale services within the store。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So first they were online then they became offline。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So in some sense they started integrating more so with their customers other
    businesses。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Then they said okay great。 Now that we've got online and we've got offline we
    can then start thinking about one big requirement。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: for the service for the companies which is inventory。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Then they started going into Shopify fulfillment networks。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this way actually they've become a competitor to Amazon but they're offering
    Shopify fulfillment。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: networks to their small and medium businesses。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/89beca2c7572e13147c648a4b20a5b6b_23.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: That's great as well。 But of course you can imagine as Shopify gets to know
    more about customers what else do they。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: start thinking about？ Well which customers should we give money to？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That's where they've gotten into funding。 So look at that entire journey from
    Shopify's perspective and their customers' perspective。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Shopify started at the end so to speak。 They started thinking about how customers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: their customers which are businesses can go， on the web。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Then they started moving upstream or also moving downstream。 So thinking about
    funding。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: thinking about fulfillment or the different point pain points。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that their customers' other businesses may have。 So that's what I mean by thinking
    carefully about the customer journey and moving upstream。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/89beca2c7572e13147c648a4b20a5b6b_25.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: and downstream。 So what I see here is that before we get into new technology
    before we start thinking about。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: AI applications don't put the cart before the horse。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/89beca2c7572e13147c648a4b20a5b6b_27.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: Start with the why。 What are your customers' needs？ What exactly are you solving
    for？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And how are you solving for is important but starting with the how sometimes
    can make。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you forget about the why。 So critically start thinking about the why first whether
    you're a B2B company。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: whether you're， a B2C company to be thinking about customer needs is critical。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Once you think about the customer needs then you start thinking about what kind
    of technology。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: may be helpful。 Is it vision AI perhaps？ Is it language AI？ Or why is AI？ What
    is it？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To me that's the next way of thinking about the how。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And then you have a good synergy between the why and the how。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So here's what I would ask you to think about。 When you start thinking about
    how you are addressing your customer needs what role are。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you playing？ Are you playing a role in the customer journey in terms of moving
    upstream？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The examples that I had given you was about Shopify， the Roku examples， even
    Amazon Prime。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and Google Home where you're curating that entire journey。 That's a big win
    if you can have that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But of course you can start smaller as well。 Start first by thinking about can
    you predict the next customer journey。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That's about predictions。 So those are the examples I was giving you around
    Amazon when it predicts for example。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: based on what you purchased what is the next thing you're going to buy。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Of course you can also start thinking about shortening the customer journey。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So think about where you can play the best role and then start thinking about
    technology。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/89beca2c7572e13147c648a4b20a5b6b_29.png)'
  prefs: []
