 To this point we've talked about two things。

![](img/6614ee4190166d8ff917d235280a1c4f_1.png)

 So first of all we've talked about managing people in some kind of unique challenges that。

 it creates and how organizations have tended to address those challenges。

 Sony has also introduced you to the magic of machine learning。 These new tools and techniques。

 technology enabled and now being used to build much stronger。

 algorithms and better predictions of a wide range of things that we have before。

 So now I think we're at a good point to really take those algorithms and apply them to the。

 problems that we described earlier of managing people。

 And think about the different ways in which machine learning can be used to improve how。

 we manage people。 Now in doing so I think a key point that I want to make。

 So these are algorithms that Sony describe。 The general purpose technologies。

 By which I mean they're kind of a set of techniques that we can apply to any problem， you know。

 be it issues of pattern recognition， training computers to identify every cat on。

 the internet solving some of production problems。 You name it。 Okay。

 so when we talk about how to apply this to managing employees what's different is。

 going to be a couple of things。 So one is figuring out what kind of data we're going to use。

 So these algorithms that Sony described what they're really very good at is take a bunch。

 of input data and an output and just figuring out which of these input data。

 So I'll talk for example about predicting nutrition。

 What are all of the signals about how people behave that we can use to predict who leads。

 So one of the key things that's figuring out what kind of data is it that will do the best。

 job of predicting who's going to leave。 So often a lot of what we're going to think about is what data could we use to make these。

 predictions， the cleverer of the data， the better the outcome。

 The other thing that we really want to think about when we apply these is how would we。

 actually use these algorithms。 Algorithms just give you predictions。

 Predictions on themselves are not useful。 And so what is it that these action neighbors do？

 What are the actions that come out of it？ So I'm going to talk about how these algorithms can be applied in three different areas of managing。

 people。 So first off engagement， tracking how motivated our employees are， how pleased they are to。

 be here。 One one attrition， figuring out who's going to stay， who's going to leave and what we can。

 do about it。

 And third building internal career paths within the organization。

 This is not an exhaustive list of all of the ways that machine learning can be used in。

 managing people。 I think it would be hard to build such an exhaustive list。

 In particular I would say though， one huge area where we're seeing machine learning being。

 used is hiring。 I'm going to ignore that because Peter's going to spend a bunch of time talking about。

 that。 I'm going to talk about these three engagement， attrition and career paths。

 We're going to start with engagement。 Thank you。 [ Silence ]。
