- en: assumption that the data are in a format where we can think about evaluating
    different conditions。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of the data。 So we sort of talked or implicitly talked about these examples
    where you might have。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: data organized in a spreadsheet。 So think about a number of columns and each
    of these columns has a little bit of information。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: about the applicant。 So you might have different columns that contain the information
    you care about and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: then you're going to use that to arrive at a decision。

- en: As we talked about earlier， if you have this information organized this way
    and you have。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: information about a decision， machine learning algorithms can learn how to navigate
    these。
  prefs: []

- en: Data however are not always so nicely structured and a lot of the interest in
    machine learning。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: has really been about the ability to use machine learning on unstructured data。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Data that aren't so easily put into columns of a spreadsheet。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So imagine using online reviews to predict something about restaurants or using
    diagnostic。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: images like we've talked about to predict something about patients or in the
    HR case， using resume。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the raw resume text itself to predict something about applicants。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In each of these cases features undergo an engineering process feature engineering。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is the process of taking raw unstructured data and pulling features out
    of the data。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in a way that it can be then used for machine learning algorithms。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So this is taking the data taking the raw data and converting it into a format。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You might think about this as a spreadsheet with columns。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So if you had raw resume data what pieces of the resume do you pull out into
    columns to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: start to use for your machine learning prediction algorithm。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And this is a time consuming and a fairly challenging process。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It also often requires a fair amount of domain expertise。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So for any of the context that we talked about diagnostic images for instance
    it requires。

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/d467553259584e8d79433404d4f8ff6b_7.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: a fair amount of expertise to think about what in the image has to be pulled
    out to start。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to make predictions about the image。 Now that's not as much of a problem as
    it sounds like for reasons we'll talk about shortly。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: here but it is useful to know that feature engineering is an important part
    of this process。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and this is really what ties these unstructured data sets into the machine learning
    process。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's the notion that you can take raw data， raw unstructured data that's not
    easily organized。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in columns and you can use that to make predictions。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One place this is becoming very relevant in the HR space is increasingly firms
    and smaller。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: companies in the technology space are thinking about making it possible to use
    other signals。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: from the interview like audio or video to make predictions about employee performance。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So you may have heard about firms or tools that will let you record an applicant's
    interview。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: be able to record an applicant's voice responses to questions and that information
    itself can。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: potentially tell you something about applicants。 But for that to work successfully
    it has to undergo this feature engineering process which。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: is to start with the audio signal or to start with the video signal and then
    engineer features。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: out of this data that can then be used to make prediction。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now I made a comment a few seconds ago about the notion that this isn't as large
    a problem。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: as it sounds like and one of the reasons for this is because of the advent of
    deep learning。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and so deep learning this is essentially where deep learning starts to shine。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So deep learning can help sidestep this feature engineering process and so one
    of the real。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: advantages of deep learning is being able to take this raw unstructured type
    of data and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: make predictions directly so we can kind of step around this process where we
    have to think。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: about well if we're looking at a video what is it about the person's gestures
    or facial。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: expressions or voice that really matters that's ultimately a guessing game in
    some respect。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: what deep learning is going to let us do is basically sidestep this process
    a little。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: bit to use all the raw information to come to arrive at predictions without
    having to go。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: through the feature extraction process。
