- en: Here， it's helpful to compare the kind of problems where we're using machine
    learning。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/96e74fb10f254da9771a2c283337c6ff_1.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: like who's going to leave， with the kind of problems where machine learning
    actually。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: does much better。 So while the excitement is there about machine learning。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: there have been a bunch of applications， where this is really revolutionized
    performance。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I think probably the best example is speech recognition。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So actually when I was preparing to record these videos， I wrote up a bunch
    of my notes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: actually using the kind of speech recognition in my computer。 I know what you're
    thinking。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You're thinking he had notes。 But anyway， when I was doing this。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I was dictating into the computer and it was frankly almost， flawless。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It was pretty much as good as if I've been dictating it to a human。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I've been playing around with speech recognition software for over 25 years。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It never used to be anywhere near that good。 You know， it used to make a mistake
    every 10 words。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now it makes a mistake every 100 words。 Right。 This really is 99% plus accuracy。
    Right。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Same kind of machine learning algorithms that Sonny was talking about。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So why is this so different to a nutrition prediction？ Well。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I think part of it is that in one case speech recognition， you're taking something。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that's already happened。 I said a word and then you're trying to classify it
    into category。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So which word was it？ Somewhat different to predicting the future。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Partly because when you're doing that kind of classification task， you kind
    of have all。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the information necessary。 So when you're doing speech recognition。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I say a word and then the computer tries to， classify it。 So let's take a look。
    Let's say turtle。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I don't know why。 Sounds like a nice word。 Say turtle。 Small amphibious creatures
    like pizza。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: according to some accounts。 Okay。 So when I say turtle， okay， what do we need
    to classify it？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We need the sound file。 So we need the data of kind of the sound waves I made
    with my voice。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We need also to know which language I'm speaking。 In some sense， with longer
    sentences。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: often it's useful to have the context for each of， the words around it。 But
    actually， in this case。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: just one word， turtle， usually the computer does a pretty， good job of recognizing
    it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It really has all the data necessary to do so。 Now let's think about an attrition
    prediction。 Okay。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What do we need to make a really accurate attrition prediction？ So， you know。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we've discussed a lot of data that will be helpful here。 So demographics。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: knowing how long they've been in the job， knowing what the job is， knowing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: their performance evaluations， what job applications they're making， posts on
    social， media。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: those sorts of things。 So we can put all that in。 Do we think that's everything
    that we need to know to make a fully accurate prediction。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of where they'll stay or leave？ No。 I mean， we can think of all sorts of other
    information that also might influence where。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: will they be offered a better job？ We don't have that in our model。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Will the better job be better paid， better commute， better for their careers？
    That would explain it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Even holding all those things constant， other things can matter。 So， for example。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: might they have to leave for reasons of ill health？ We don't have that in our
    model。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Might they decide to leave work to look after a family member or maybe relocate
    because they。
  prefs: []

    company。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They've done it and now this person's gone to join them。 There are some personality
    factors there。
  prefs: []

- en: So even holding all those sorts of things constant， we can imagine that somebody
    who's。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: easily bored and likes changing their lives is going to be more likely to leave。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Somebody who's really risk averse is going to be less likely to leave。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Maybe even holding all these things constant。 We don't know everything。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Maybe they're secretly in love with one of their colleagues。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They're unable to consider working anywhere else without them and so they're
    not going， to leave。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: Kind of on the personality level， there are so many different aspects of their
    personality。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that might affect decisions， we're unlikely to have measured out all of them。
    But even beyond that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: there are so many things outside the individual that shape their behaviour，
    what they behave。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You might describe it as kind of an open system。 Even if I just perfectly understand
    you。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that's not going to be enough because I also。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: need to understand your interactions with everybody else in the organisation。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And then I also need to understand your interactions with all of the opportunities
    outside the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: organisation。 There are so many things that go into whether or not you leave。
    So many of them。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we can't measure and we're never really going to measure。 It's not just whether
    you leave。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So when we look at some of the other things， again， hiring， we're trying to
    predict performance。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: All of those external factors also shape your performance。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So many things you'd like to know which you never can。 So without that data。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: with all of these different complex factors and interactions that shape， you。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it becomes very hard to make very strong predictions。 Thank you。 [BLANK_AUDIO]。
