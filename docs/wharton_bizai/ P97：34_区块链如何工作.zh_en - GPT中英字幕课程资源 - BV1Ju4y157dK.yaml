  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We've been talking about the blockchain in pretty abstract terms as a technology
    that。
  prefs: []

- en: '![](img/4045400e9ac217dc63e2e6fd9cf447bd_1.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: can allow people to store data in a way that's trusted without requiring a third
    party intermediary。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's useful at a high level at least to talk a little bit about how it works
    just to give。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you a flavor of what's actually happening in the blockchain where it's providing
    value。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The blockchain can be viewed as a ledger or a spreadsheet。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If we think about storing data in this kind of a format and we want it to be
    trusted。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we want to be able to look at the data and trust it completely， we need to know
    essentially。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: two things and only two things。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/4045400e9ac217dc63e2e6fd9cf447bd_3.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: One is that the transaction， the piece of information that's put into the database
    was， verified by。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: if there's a transaction between two people for example， that the transaction。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: is verified by each of the two parties， that the information that was originally
    put in。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/4045400e9ac217dc63e2e6fd9cf447bd_5.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: the database is legitimate。 Then number two that it was never。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we'd never gone back and changed falsified， updated， or deleted that piece of
    information。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If we know these two things， we can be sure that the information we're seeing
    in the blockchain。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: is correct。 So number one that the original information was valid and verified
    in number two that nobody。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: went back and changed that information。 This is what the blockchain achieved。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The first one actually the verification we've been doing for a long time but
    the blockchain。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the second one is what the blockchain achieves。 Making sure。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: making sure that we can be sure that no one has gone back and falsified， updated，
    or deleted data。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So the blockchain again is ledger spreadsheets， a little bit different though
    than a single。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: spreadsheet。 It's essentially identical copies of spreadsheets or ledgers that
    are stored all across。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the network。 These are called nodes。 So all across participating nodes of the
    networks。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of these networks and information is recorded， in a sequential chain of blocks
    and this is where it gets the name blockchain from。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And each of these blocks holds changes in the world that have happened since
    the last， block。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so the current state of the world is kind of computed by looking at the
    entire sequence。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of blocks， not just the last block。 And so the whole sequence of blocks together
    kind of explains the state of the world。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/4045400e9ac217dc63e2e6fd9cf447bd_7.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: So it's got this system where it uses a bunch of spreadsheets all around the
    network and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: records information in a sequence of blocks， all of which together express the
    state of， the world。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And we have design points to know to understand how the blockchain is providing
    value。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One is that any transaction， any information that is put in the blockchain is
    verified using。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a form of encryption。 So let's say we're using the blockchain to keep information
    about skills。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: about some， skill that I obtain online。 So the transaction might be between
    me and the provider of that skill based education。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So that transaction itself is verified using a form of encryption， both counterparties。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: meaning myself and the platform might say this person has the skills， this transaction。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: is then confirmed by the network and stored in a chain of blocks。 So that's
    design point one。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: All these transactions are verified when they're first put in。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And then design point two is that the blockchain itself is designed in a way
    that is exceedingly。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: difficult to try to fake data or cheat the system by going back and changing
    data。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/4045400e9ac217dc63e2e6fd9cf447bd_9.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: So unlike a database where it's fairly easy to change data， the blockchain，
    the design。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of the blockchain is such that's actually very expensive， prohibitively expensive
    in。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: most cases to go back and try to falsify or fake or change data in the past。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so the second design point is really what provides that verification that
    the data。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: is authentic and it stays authentic all the way through。 So because of this。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the blockchain is a data storage technology finally that prevents any。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of the spaking or rewriting of entries。 And so if the information is verified
    in the first place。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it's never been changed。 Therefore， we know that it must be true。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And we don't again need a third party to say， hey， this is a valid piece of
    information。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We know that because of the design of the system， the information that is being
    presented。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to us within reason at least must be true。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/4045400e9ac217dc63e2e6fd9cf447bd_11.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: It turns out again that this solves a number of problems。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So information in a blockchain can inherently be trusted。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So it doesn't therefore require a third party to hold the data。 And as we talked
    about last time。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: this is going to potentially provide a number of changes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to different industries in terms of what the role of trust brokers are and what
    value they。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: provide at various different points in the workflow。 [ Silence ]， [BLANK_AUDIO]。
