 Hi， in this lecture we are going to conclude our discussion of personalization and recommendation。

 systems。 Recollect that in the last lecture we talked about certain challenges or trade-offs associated。

 with recommended design。 To recap that discussion。

 one of the main advantages of collaborative filtering is that。

 it does not require deep metadata about the products being recommended and therefore it。

 is very easy to build。 At the same time it is quite effective and has been shown to help consumers discover。

 new products。 And it has a nice social appeal， for example。

 knowing that other people like me or consuming， certain songs increases my interest in that song as well。

 However， there are some cons with this design。 We talked about how the collaborative filter design has a popularity bias and that is one。

 challenge especially if as a retailer you want to expose your customers to your back catalog。 Also。

 because these systems do not have deep knowledge about the products being recommended。

 they cannot explain why certain products are being recommended to the users。 And finally。

 they also tend to have challenges with new users and new items。 In contrast。

 content based recommenders actually do not have a popularity bias。

 They are also quite effective and also they have deep knowledge about the products being。

 recommended and they can explain the rationale behind the recommendations to consumers。

 But it is quite costly and expensive to build because you need detailed metadata about the。

 products being recommended。 So the question that arises is whether there is a way to actually combine the two so that。

 you get the benefits of the two。 And this is a direction in which many companies have gone in recent years。

 One example is Spotify。 So for those of you who are used to using Spotify。

 you are quite familiar perhaps with the Spotify， Discover Weekly recommendations where Spotify curates set up songs for you to listen to。

 Now Spotify's Discover Weekly started off initially as a collaborative filtering based， design。

 So originally Spotify's recommenders were based purely on collaborative filtering。

 But over time it has combined content based recommender design principles as well。

 Now in order to do content based recommendations， one needs very rich metadata about the musical。

 qualities of songs。 This is expensive to gather if you are going to do it the way Pandora did it when it originally。

 started its service。 Meaning have artists listen to songs and rate these songs。

 So an alternative is to use machine learning to automatically extract the attributes of， songs。

 Spotify does this in two ways。 Just Spotify crawls the web to look at blog posts or any online discussions of songs。

 And looks at the kinds of descriptive language people use when they discuss or describe songs。

 And it uses those descriptive words as attributes of the song。

 Now this is very useful for songs that have been out there for a while and that are discussed。

 quite heavily。 Now new songs or niche songs represent a challenge because they are not discussed as much online。

 To address that， Spotify uses machine learning to analyze the audio signal of each of the， song。

 And it is now able to extract the number of musical qualities such as the tempo of the， songs。

 whether the song has major key tonality or not， how loud is the song， how much instrumentation。

 is there in the song and so on。

 Ultimately， Spotify can use all of these content attributes that it extracts using。

 machine learning and pair it with collaborative filtering type of features looking at what。

 other people are consuming and therefore combine the best of the two worlds。

 This is also a direction in which Netflix is gone and many of the major media companies。

 and online companies have gone in the direction of combining the best of both these different。

 recommendation designs。 Now of course， we've spent a lot of time talking about product recommendations。

 mostly because， they are very pervasive and they had very significant value to both the retailer or the。

 firm and the consumer as well。 But it's important to acknowledge that personalization is not just product recommendations。

 It is also about customizing customer experience across the different channels where you interact。

 with customers that may be on your website， that may be on a mobile app， that may be on。

 an email or that may be at a store。 It's the ability to actually figure out how to provide a holistic integrated experience。

 for the customer and that's what personalization is all about。 So for example。

 companies today are even personalizing emails。 So an email is sent out to the customer database but some of the content in the email might。

 be populated in real time when a customer opens the email。

 So the email might be sent in an HTML format meaning in the same format as a webpage and。

 when a customer opens the email then a certain JavaScript might be called which looks at the。

 customer's location where they opened the email and it might customize the image。 For example。

 if the email is for a promotion for sales of jackets， the emails might be。

 personalized where if a customer opens it in a location where it's currently raining。

 they might see a rain jacket where if a customer opens it in a location where it's currently。

 snowing， they might see an image for a snow jacket and this personalization is done on。

 the fly at the time when a customer opens the email based on running script and being。

 able to look at the customer's past data。 Now having said all of this。

 personalization adds a lot of value to both consumers and， firms but it also poses certain risks。

 One of those risks is misapplication meaning when your recommendation or personalization。

 algorithm makes sweeping generalizations about the customer and makes very poor recommendations。

 and this ultimately turns off the customer from personalization。 Another concern is data privacy。

 Consumer sensitivity to privacy is increasing significantly especially given how much information。

 companies have about customers and also because of rampant abuse of customer data by certain。

 companies and so it's very important for companies to be careful about how they use。

 data and the way they present personalization results because it's easy to cross a line that。

 appears creepy to consumers。 And lastly， another risk with excessive personalization based on very sensitive consumer data is that。

 regulators might step in and indeed in many jurisdictions regulators are stepping in and。

 releasing a number of different data privacy regulations and so regulatory compliance also。

 imposes a certain new burden on companies as they start to do more and more personalization。

 Now that is an overview of personalization and how machine learning in particular and。

 AI in general is having an impact。 Next we will talk about applications of machine learning in financial services。
