    when。

- en: using deep learning。 So it avoids the feature engineering step， but let's skip
    that step。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It leads to incredible accuracy improvements in a number of domains。 So the
    question arises。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: why not always just use deep learning？ Was a number of drawbacks？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I'll talk about three of the most important。 One is the scale of the data required。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So the first question is， do you have an enormous amount of data， or at least
    a very large amount。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of data。 So relative to other approaches， deep learning is going to require
    much more training data。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: than other approaches。 You need lots of data， you need lots of variation in
    the data for deep learning engines to perform。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: well。 So that's number one。 Closer related is that what comes along with needing
    more data is you need much more data。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: storage， and you also need much more computational power。 So to run or train
    a deep learning model。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you really need a lot more computational power。 You need much more data storage
    space to go along with all that data。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So the hardware requirements of deep learning are much more significant than
    they are for。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: other approaches。 The third reason that deep learning may not be right for a
    particular approach is the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: question of how important is it to have insight into why a model made a specific
    decision or。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a prediction model made a specific decision。 So one of the challenges with deep
    learning is that with these neural networks。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it's often， difficult to go into the neural network and understand why a particular
    prediction was。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: made in a particular direction or not。 So in some context。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it becomes really important to understand why a particular prediction is， made。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Think about a healthcare context， for instance。

- en: If you make a judgment about a patient， it may be very important to be able
    to explain to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that patient exactly why that decision was arrived at。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For somebody with a lot of expertise like a doctor， it may be very important
    to be able。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to understand why an algorithm is recommending one thing or another。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If there's no insight into that， it's going to be hard that doctor may not want
    to use。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that recommendation。 Same thing with something like customer loan processing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If a particular decision is arrived at， it may be very important to be able
    to explain。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to someone why that decision was reached。 It turns out that with other machine
    learning models that are simpler。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it's often much easier， to understand why it is or how it was that the algorithm
    went from the data or the input。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: data to the final decision。 With deep learning， this is much more complicated。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So in certain contexts where this kind of interpretability or explainability
    becomes very。
  prefs: []
